This RAND Corporation technical report summarizes the views of 55 leading researchers in
the United States, the European Union, Switzerland, and Russia regarding the competitiveness
of Japanese research in 25 fields in the life sciences, environmental science, information and
communication technology, and nanotechnology and materials science. Their responses cover
several topics, including how the quality of research in Japan in these fields ranks against the
world’s leaders, strengths and weaknesses in the Japanese research and education system, and
suggestions of approaches, models, and mechanisms to increase excellence in Japanese research
in these 25 fields and in expanding Japan’s science and technology capacity in general.
This research was conducted for the Mitsubishi Research Institute (MRI) of Japan to
provide data and analysis toward the preparation of a report by MRI for the government of
Japan in its current efforts to develop the next basic plan for science and technology for 2011
to 2015. MRI asked RAND to conduct interviews with leading scientists in the United States,
the European Union, and Switzerland to address these issues. This is the second time RAND
is providing research support to MRI and the government of Japan toward the formulation of
its basic plan for science and technology. In 2004, RAND completed a study with a similar
focus and approach (Wong et al., 2004). Those interested in the social and structural analysis
of science, as well as individuals interested in developments in science and technology in Japan,
may find this report of interest.
The RAND Transportation, Space, and Technology Program
This research was conducted under the auspices of the Transportation, Space, and Technology
(TST) Program within RAND Infrastructure, Safety, and Environment (ISE). ISE’s mission
is to improve the development, operation, use, and protection of society’s essential physical
assets and natural resources and to enhance the related social assets of safety and security of

	<b><a name="T3">Summary</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
The Japanese government places great emphasis on ensuring the country’s vitality in science
and technology (S&T) and remaining at the forefront of global science. It is in this spirit that
Japan uses its five-year basic S&T plans, the first of which was introduced in 1996, to guide
research and development (R&D) promotion (see Government of Japan, 2006).
This RAND report documents input and recommendations we received from 55 top
researchers on their perceptions of the current state of Japanese S&T and priorities for
improvement.
Study Objective
The current basic S&T plan―the third one―will run through 2010, and efforts are under
way to develop the next basic S&T plan for 2011 to 2015. The Mitsubishi Research Institute
(MRI) of Japan, which is providing research support to the Council for Science and Technology
Policy (CSTP), an advisory body in the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan, in the formulation
of the 2011C2015 basic S&T plan, asked the RAND Corporation to interview 50 top
researchers in the United States, the European Union (EU), and Switzerland to learn from
their perspective how well Japan performs in their fields and areas of research and to solicit
their thoughts on what is essential to promote excellence and innovation in scientific research.
The expert responses and recommendations collected would feed into analysis by MRI for the
government of Japan in developing the fourth basic S&T plan, for 2011 to 2015.1
Study Method
Since the objective and scope of this study is the same as the 2004 RAND study for MRI,
we employed the same study method used for the 2004 study. It is important to reiterate that
the objective of this research is to collect qualitative feedback from U.S.- and European-based
experts and to produce a summary of their responses in a final report. As such, we do not have the mandate or the time and resources to review literature on the current state of Japanese S&T
or to produce a final report with anything beyond what we were tasked to do.
Our research began with the identification of experts in the designated 25 scientific fields
under the four categories of life sciences, environmental science, information and communication
technology (ICT), and nanotechnology and materials science (see Table S.1). These four
categories and the 25 fields under them were the same as in the 2004 RAND study and provided
to us by our research sponsor.
To identify and select experts for interviews, we utilized a combination of methods to
draw on the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of each to determine a researcher’s prominence
in his or her field. The results of searches using one method (e.g., searching databases on
scientific publications and citations) were checked against the results of searches using another
method (e.g., identifying recipients of major merit awards). We also cross-checked researchers
recommended to us by respondents or colleagues to ascertain their professional achievements
before we added them to our list of candidate respondents. In all, we identified more than 200
experts across the 25 fields.
For this study, our respondents included junior scientists who are “rising stars” in their
own fields. The decision to include such junior scientists was made in consultation with our
sponsor. By rising stars, we mean those younger and high-performing researchers who work at
the cutting edge of their fields. We thought that the perspectives and experience of rising stars
may well complement those of senior, more-established researchers who represent the moreconventional
definition of top expert. With increased Japanese government efforts to expand
opportunities for young international researchers to work in Japan under its current and previous basic S&T plans, rising stars could inform us of their experience in Japan or their reasons
for choosing (or not choosing) to work in Japan.


<a href= "pic02.html">Categories and Fields</a><br><br>


In the end, 55 experts out of nearly 100 contacted spoke with us. We gave priority to
contacting those with the highest professional qualifications (e.g., top scientific prize winners
and those regarded as the most influential in their fields) for interviews. We also tried to collect
data from experts in each of the 25 fields. Since participation was strictly voluntary and
research had to be completed within a time frame and with the resources available, we could
not have, say, one expert each from the United States or Europe for each of the 25 fields or have
one expert each who is male or female for each of the 25 fields. All interviews were conducted
via telephone, and all the information we received was treated as confidential. Table S.2 shows
the number of respondents for each field and some attributes of our respondents.
First, in terms of the number of respondents for each category, the largest number is in
the life sciences, followed by nanotechnology and materials science, environmental science,
and ICT. By location, 19 of our 55 respondents are U.S.-based, 24 are EU-based, and one each
is in Switzerland and Russia. By category, an even number of respondents in the life sciences
and ICT are based in the United States and Europe, while, in the environmental science and
nanotechnology and materials science categories, the number of European-based respondents
significantly outnumbers the U.S.-based ones. (Although our sponsor did not name Russia as a location, our effort to identify top experts pointed to a few Russia-based scientists, and one
accepted our request for interview.)

<a href= "pic03.html">Number of Respondents, by Key Attributes</a><br><br>

By career point, 42 senior and 13 junior researchers spoke with us. Among the senior
researchers, 14 are in the life sciences, eight in environmental science, seven in ICT, and 13 in
nanotechnology and materials science. For the junior researchers, their numbers for these categories
are four, three, three, and three, respectively. Further, by career point and location, senior
European-based researchers are the largest subgroup, followed by senior U.S.-based researchers
(15), junior European-based researchers (nine), and junior U.S.-based researchers (four).
In terms of gender alone, there were 44 male and 11 female respondents. Female researchers
made up half of all respondents in the life sciences, but they were in far smaller numbers
in the other three categories. Combining gender and career point, senior male researchers lead
(37), followed by junior male (seven), junior female (six), and senior female (five) researchers.
As for their level of professional experience in Japan or with Japanese research, we designated
28 respondents as low, 14 as moderate, and 13 as high. The greatest number and share
of respondents with high designations are found in the life sciences and nanotechnology and
materials science. These designations are based on a combination of respondent self-assessment
and the content of their responses. Low means that one has had little or no current or prior collaborations
with Japanese researchers and institutions, few or no visits to Japan, and minimal
awareness of Japanese research in their research areas. Moderate means that one has had had
some prior collaborations with Japanese researchers or institutions, some visits to Japan and
interactions with Japanese researchers at professional forums in Japan or elsewhere, and some
awareness of Japanese research in their research areas. High means that one has had or has current
or recent collaborations with Japanese researchers or institutions; multiple visits to Japan;
experience teaching, doing research, or participating in advisory panels in Japan; and in-depth
awareness of Japanese research in their research areas.
Finally, all questions in our telephone interviews were open-ended, and respondents could
choose to answer all or none of them as they pleased. Our questions focus on these areas provided
by MRI and CSTP:
 competitiveness of Japanese S&T institutions, especially how Japan compares with other
scientifically advanced nations
 important scientific research accomplishments in Japan, with a particular focus on the
past five years
 quality of Japanese science education
 ideas for Japan or lessons learned from experience on how to increase excellence in
national S&T capacity.

	<b><a name="T4">Expert Responses and Recommendations</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Considering the small sample size and that the expert comments we received are subjective and
may be more reflective of individual experiences, observations, and impressions than any collective
truth about Japan or Japanese S&T, we appreciate the need for caution in interpreting
their responses. We recognize that other research and data (e.g., citations and patent data) can
provide a useful context to interpret the responses we collected. However, it is not within the scope of this study to assess the validity of the viewpoints or the appropriateness of the recommendations
provided by our respondents.
Overall, 22 of our 55 respondents reported that Japan is at the forefront, among the
top five leaders, or has demonstrated significant improvement in their specific research areas.
Another dozen reported that Japan is doing very well, produces high-quality research, or is
among the ten leaders in the world. This compares well with the responses received in our 2004
study. Similarly, though, respondents frequently qualified their assessments that Japan’s excellence
is in technology development, applied research, or areas in which expensive equipment is
required rather than in theoretical or fundamental research.
Consistent with a major observation from experts interviewed for the 2004 study, too, is
the widespread view that significant institutional and cultural problems hinder excellence in
Japanese S&T. More than two-thirds of our respondents across all fields and other attributes
made comments to this effect. Also, despite observations of improved performance (e.g., more
Japanese research articles published in major international academic journals, more substantive
Japanese participation in international conferences and seminars, more opportunities for international
researchers in Japan, and positive changes, such as special grants for young scientists
and less hierarchical environments at places like RIKEN), our respondents generally emphasized
that Japan has to do more and hasten the speed of change. In this regard, about onequarter
of all respondents highlighted, in particular, their perception of rapid improvements
in S&T in China and India overall or within their own fields, and several commented that
Chinese and Indian researchers were more independent and bold in their approach to research
than Japanese researchers. These traits, in their view, will help to propel Chinese and Indian
researchers to the forefront of global science.
Also, our respondents did not generally characterize Japanese research as creative or innovative,
even though it was invariably described as good or on par with the top one, two, or
three leaders in the world. About one-fifth of the respondents attributed their perception of
lack of creativity and critical thinking in Japanese research to rigidities in Japanese culture.
On research funding in Japan, respondents in general perceived Japan to provide a high
level of R&D support. Their criticisms lie in how the funds are allocated. About half a dozen
respondents explicitly criticized the bias in funding for older, established researchers, and about
half spoke of a need to move away from top-downCdriven funding in R&D and the need for
merit-based awards and urged special grants to support young researchers.
Finally, more than half of our respondents saw the general absence of female researchers
in Japan and low proficiency in English and communication skills as serious weaknesses in any
effort to improve Japan’s S&T performance.
Feedback from our 55 respondents does not appear to differ by location or career points.
As for gender, both male and female respondents across all fields, locations, and career points
spoke of the need to expand opportunities for female and junior researchers in Japan. Generally,
those respondents identified as having a high level of experience in Japan or with Japanese
research have a more positive opinion of Japanese research (e.g., lauding the achievements of a
particular Japanese research team or noting the success of special programs that target young
researchers). Yet, they were no less critical of perceived shortcomings and weaknesses in the
Japanese S&T institutions and communities.
Recommendations from our respondents focused on six points (presented by frequency
with which they were mentioned and not in order of sequence or hierarchy). They are consistent
with those recommended by the experts we interviewed for our 2004 study.


1. Prioritize proficiency in oral and written English to improve communication and interactions
with the international scientific community at meetings, submissions to academic
journals, in online dialogues, and the like.
2. Emphasize merit in research funding, promotion, hiring, and all else to mitigate social
and institutional barriers that permeate research organizations and management bodies
in Japan.
3. Increase the number of short-term visits by international scientists (e.g., to attend conferences
and through fixed-term fellowships in Japan), and fully integrate foreign students,
faculty, and researchers into the Japanese system.
4. Increase the number of students, faculty, and researchers Japan sends overseas for education,
exchanges, and short-term stays (e.g., one- to two-year postdoctoral fellowships
and yearlong sabbaticals).
5. Emphasize critical, independent thinking skills in Japan’s secondary and tertiary education
systems.
6. Continue to fund research, including more support for international R&D, and to
improve research facilities and workplace quality.

	<b><a name="T7">CHAPTER ONE Introduction</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Japan introduced its first five-year basic science and technology (S&T) plan (1996C2000) in
1996. The second basic plan (2001C2005) and the third basic plan (2006C2010) (Government
of Japan, 2006) followed, and preparations are now under way to formulate the fourth basic
plan (2011C2015). These basic plans support Japanese government efforts to promote research
and development (R&D) activities―specifically, according to the Japanese government, to
meet social and economic needs, create intellectual assets for Japan, enable Japan to contribute
to global science and international development, and define measures necessary to achieve
these goals.
The Japanese government places great emphasis on ensuring the country’s vitality in S&T
and on remaining at the forefront of global science. It is in this spirit that the Japanese government
uses its basic S&T plans to guide R&D promotion.
Objective of the Study
The Mitsubishi Research Institute (MRI) of Japan, which is providing research support to
the Japanese government in the formulation of the next basic S&T plan, asked the RAND
Corporation to interview 50 top researchers across 25 scientific fields in the life sciences, environmental
science, information and communication technology (ICT), and nanotechnology
and materials science in the United States, the European Union (EU), and Switzerland. Our
task is to collect their personal assessments of how well Japan performs in their fields and areas
of research, including major R&D accomplishments; strengths and weaknesses of Japanese
research institutions; quality of students, young scientists, and researchers in Japan; and to
solicit interviewees’ input on what is essential to promote excellence and innovation in scientific
research.
The expert responses and recommendations collected would feed into analysis by MRI for
the government of Japan, specifically the Council for Science and Technology Policy (CSTP),
to formulate the fourth basic S&T plan.1 CSTP, located in the Office of the Prime Minister of
Japan, is responsible for shaping S&T policy in Japan.

Study Method
MRI, in consultation with CSTP, defined the 25 fields and placed them in the four major categories
shown in Table 1.1. These fields and categories were chosen because they are priorities
in the current S&T basic plan of Japan (2006C2010) and because the Japanese government has
the explicit goal of improving Japan’s world standing in these fields. (We recognize that these
fields and categories do not necessarily represent a definitive taxonomy of all scientific research.
Nor are they exclusionary of one another, because the boundaries of S&T fields are always
fuzzy and are becoming increasingly so as research becomes more interdisciplinary.)
Since the objective and scope of this study is the same as the 2004 RAND study for MRI,
we employed the same study method used for the 2004 project. It is important to reiterate that
the objective of this research is to collect qualitative feedback from U.S.- and European-based
experts and to produce a summary of their responses in a final report. As such, we do not have
the mandate or the time and resources to review literature on the current state of Japanese S&T
or to produce a final report with anything beyond what we were tasked to do.
Participation in the interviews was strictly voluntary. Respondents were asked open-ended
questions that focused on four topics chosen by MRI and CSTP:2

competitiveness of Japanese S&T institutions, especially how Japan compares with other
scientifically advanced nations
important scientific research accomplishments in Japan, with a particular focus on the
past five years
quality of Japanese science education
ideas for Japan or lessons learned from experience on how to increase excellence in national
S&T capacity (e.g., other institutional models or national mechanisms that are perceived
as most successful to foster excellent research so that extensive experience with the Japanese
system was not a requirement for identifying leading researchers).


<a href= "pic02.html">Categories and Fields</a><br><br>


All information received is treated with confidentiality. Respondents had the prerogative
to answer any or none of the questions as they pleased. They could also provide comments on
other matters or issues that they believed were pertinent to S&T capacity building in general
and for Japan in particular.
For this study, our respondents included junior scientists who are “rising stars” in their
own fields. The decision to include such junior scientists was made in consultation with our
sponsor. By rising stars, we mean those younger and high-performing researchers who work
at the cutting edge of their fields. We thought that the perspectives and experience of rising
stars could complement those of senior, more-established researchers who represent the moreconventional
definition of top expert. With increased Japanese government efforts to expand
opportunities for young international researchers to work in Japan under its current and previous
basic S&T plans, rising stars could inform us of their experience in Japan or their reasons
for choosing (or not choosing) to work in Japan.
We identified respondents using a combination of methods because each method has
strengths and limitations and affords us different metrics to gauge a researcher’s prominence
in his or her field. The results of searches using one method were checked against the results
of searches using one or several other methods to ascertain whether an individual researcher
would meet our definition of expert. Alternatively, the results of searches using one method
might be used to generate searches using another tool or method. In general, each potential
respondent must be considered a highly influential scientist by more than one method.
First, we made use of databases on scientific publications and citations. Specifically, we
used two ISI Web of Knowledge databases: the Science Citation Index and the Journal Citation
Reports. Results generated by searches in these two databases were then compared against
individuals identified through other methods described to ascertain their expert status.
In utilizing the Science Citation Index, the main search criteria were number of publications
and citations. The results show how often, in what journal, and by whom a scholarly
article is published or cited. The citation criterion suggests whether a researcher has published
influential research. Quality outweighs quantity in determining whether particular researchers
should be regarded as leaders or experts in their fields or subfields.
The Journal Citation Reports differ from the Science Citation Index in that they rank
journals by field, number of citations, and other factors, including timeliness of the research,
editorial content, and international diversity of authors. This allowed the RAND team to
gauge the impact of particular research publications, as well as the extent to which publications
are the results of collaborations involving individuals from different institutions and countries.
For the purpose of this research, we narrowed our search to researchers who are based
in the United States, Canada, EU, and Switzerland. It is the location of their institutional
affiliation that interests us, not their country of birth, ethnicity, or citizenship, because that is
where the system of S&T best practices occurs. In searching for agricultural-science experts, for example, we used the keywords “agriculture” and “agricultural science,” then filtered the
results by subject areas defined by Web of Knowledge. These subject areas for agriculturalscience
experts were “agriculture,” “multidisciplinary,” “agronomy,” “food science and technology,”
and “agricultural engineering.” Then the results were sorted by country, to produce
a total of 3,010 articles in agriculture. We further refined our sorting by criteria that included
“the most-cited authors” and “the most-published authors” based on information provided in
the citation databases. Journals in which these most-cited authors and most-published authors
are named were compared with the elite, top-tier journals in this field. The most-elite, top-tier
journals for agricultural research in 2007 were the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry
and Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment. The same method was repeated for other research
areas, producing several hundred names in total as potential candidates for our interviews.
Second, we identified researchers by going directly to particular elite, top-tier general and
field-specific scientific journals (e.g., Nature, Science, Physical Review Letters). General ones,
such as Nature and Science, are widely known, while expertise within the RAND research
team guided selection of field-specific ones.3 We used names of researchers who have published
in these elite, top-tier journals to generate additional searches using the Science Citation Index
and the Journal Citation Reports with the method just described and cross-checked them
against the initial list generated.
We did this because a major weakness of the two ISI Web of Knowledge databases is that
they do not discriminate well between scientists with similar names―that is, a search may
identify not only the works of the intended scientist but also those belonging to other scientists
with similar names. Another weakness is that the frequency with which a paper is cited is not
a true indication of its quality. A paper might be cited many times over because it is used to
illustrate what is not done right in research, for example. Also, when publications have multiple
authors―and they frequently do―citation databases do not tell us the level or quality of
contribution made by a particular author. Thus, we use authorship in these top-tier journals as
a means to refine our search for researchers responsible for the most-influential or -innovative
work.
Third, in addition to citations, we used major merit awards as another way to identify and
refine our search for top researchers. By major merit awards, we mean those that are intended
to honor the professional stature or contributions of their recipients, and they may or may not
include monetary grants for research. We also consider induction into prestigious bodies, such
as membership in the National Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society, as a type of major
merit award. We believe that to be selected to receive a major merit award is a clear reflection
of professional success in the eyes of one’s peers. Some major merit awards honor cumulative
accomplishments or general reputation; some are more specific to a field or type of accomplishment.
Since awards often honor a career body of work, we do not impose a five-year time frame
on them. These awards include the Comstock Prize in Physics, the David Adler Lectureship
Award in the Field of Materials Physics, the J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics,
and the Wolf Foundation Prize in Physics, as well other awards given by the Alexander von
Humboldt Foundation, the Association for Computing Machinery, the Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique, the International Mathematical Union, and the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences. For junior researchers, we focused on field-specific awards (e.g., the Beckman Young Investigators Program) and those that target outstanding young scientists in all research
fields worldwide (e.g., the European Young Investigator Awards).
Again, researchers identified via this method were cross-checked against others used to
determine their expert status. For example, we would search the publication record of recipients
of major awards and against the results of our citation and publication searches.
Fourth, we looked for those individuals who hold top leadership positions at major professional
societies and the editorial boards of journals with the highest impact factors in their
fields (as indicated by the Journal Citation Reports) or serve on selection committees for major
merit awards. To serve in such capacities, experts must have a deep awareness of what is the
state of the art in research. They must also (in theory, at least) understand what has helped
advance their field and what may chart its path into the future. Internet searches for the websites
of major professional societies, top-tier journals, and awards enabled us to identify experts
who fall into this category. We also utilized online access to a database of scientists from all
over the world that the European Science Foundation compiles and maintains to identify peer
reviewers for its research-grant selections. And again, the names for individuals identified using
this method were subject to searches using other methods described here.
Our final, and fifth, method involved referrals from the researchers we contacted for
interviews. The researchers we contacted, identified through the above steps, were deemed to
have the expertise necessary to address the questions raised in this study or know about R&D
in Japan. Considering their expertise and professional networks within their fields, we believe
that they are in a good position to give us additional candidates for interviews. In this manner,
we received a small number of suggestions, and their professional qualifications were vetted
using the methods described before their names were added to our list of researchers to contact
for interviews.
In contacting researchers for interviews, RAND-approved human subjectCprotection
protocols were used to ensure compliance with federal regulations for the protection of personal
data. This includes a data-safeguarding plan that describes how the data collected for
this investigation will be stored, how long they will be kept, and when they will be destroyed.
All RAND researchers on this project signed a data confidentiality agreement, which states
the responsibilities involved in data collection, storage, transfer, and use. Finally, we provided
respondents information on the purpose of this study and how the data collected would be
handled and used, and we obtained their oral consent prior to beginning our telephone interviews
with them.
Interviews were completed between November 2008 and February 2009. Participation
in this study was strictly voluntary, and a semistructured questionnaire (see Appendix A) was
used to guide our conversations with them. Respondents were free to answer any of the questions
(or none at all) and in an open-ended fashion. All interviews were done via telephone
subsequently to initial contact via email. The interviews lasted between 45 and 60 minutes on
average. Most were conducted in English and some in German, French, Italian, and Spanish.
Summaries for each interview―stripped of all personally identifiable data, in the interest of
confidentiality―can be found in Appendix B. 


Characterizing Our Respondents
We completed interviews with a total of 55 researchers after contacting about 100 of the
researchers identified. We gave priority to contacting those with the highest professional qualifications
(e.g., top scientific prize winners and those regarded as most influential in their fields).
We also tried to collect data from experts for each of the 25 fields. Since participation was
voluntary, the number of researchers for each category and field, as well as by other attributes
shown in Table 1.2, is strictly the result of individual researchers accepting our request for
input. Thus, having more respondents in the life sciences than other categories or more female
researchers in the life sciences than other categories may be happenstance. We caution against
any assumptions without more in-depth investigation.
All 55 respondents are affiliated with universities or publicly funded research laboratories
or both. By location, a total of 20 respondents are based in the United States, 33 in the EU,
one in Switzerland, and one in Russia. (Although our sponsor did not name Russia as a location,
our effort to identify top experts pointed to a few Russia-based ones, and one accepted
our request for interview.) More than two-thirds of them had received graduate education,
did postdoctoral research, or had held professorships outside their birth countries or in multiple countries. Also, among our respondents, one was originally from Japan. This researcher
informed us that he left Japan for graduate education and a career in the United States because
he thinks that the United States offers superior education and professional opportunities to
those in Japan. These respondents’ international mobility reflects the global nature of science.

<a href= "pic03.html">Number of Respondents, by Key Attributes</a><br><br>

In terms of the number of respondents for each category, the largest number is in the
life sciences, followed by nanotechnology and materials science, environmental science, and
ICT. By category, an even number of respondents are based in the United States and Europe
in the life sciences and ICT (nine and five, respectively), while the number of European-based
respondents significantly outnumbers the U.S.-based ones in the environmental science and
materials science categories (nine to two and 13 to three, respectively).
In terms of their career point, 42 senior and 13 junior researchers spoke with us. Among
the senior researchers, 14 are in the life sciences, eight in environmental science, seven in ICT,
and 13 in nanotechnology and materials science. For the junior researchers, their numbers for
these categories are four, three, three, and three, respectively. Further, by career point and location,
senior European-based researchers are the largest subgroup, followed by senior U.S.-based
researchers (15), junior European-based researchers (nine), and junior U.S.-based researchers
(four).
By gender alone, there were 44 male and 11 female respondents. Female researchers made
up half of all respondents in the life sciences, but they were in far smaller numbers in the other
three categories. Combining gender and career point, senior male researchers lead (37), followed
by junior male (seven), junior female (six), and senior female (five) researchers.
As for their level of professional experience in Japan or with Japanese research, 28 respondents
were designed as low, 14 as moderate, and 13 as high. The greatest number and share
of respondents with high designations are found in the life sciences and nanotechnology and
materials science. These designations are based on a combination of respondent self-assessment
and the content of their responses.
Among respondents based in the United States, eight have a low level, five have a moderate
level, and six have a high level of professional experience in Japan or with Japanese research.
Among respondents based in Europe, 21 have a low level, seven have a moderate level, and
seven have a high level of professional experience in Japan or with Japanese research.
The designation of low, moderate, or high is based on a combination of respondent selfassessment
and the information the RAND research team received from the respondents.
This attribute, we believe, informs our interpretation of their responses. We consider as low
those experts with no current or prior collaborations with Japanese researchers and institutions,
few or no visits to Japan, and minimal awareness of Japanese research in their research areas.
Those with a moderate level might have had prior collaborations with Japanese researchers or
institutions, some visits to Japan and interactions with Japanese researchers at professional
forums in Japan or elsewhere in the world, and some awareness of Japanese research in their
research areas. Those with a high level might have current or recent collaborations with Japanese
researchers or institutions or multiple visits to Japan; experience teaching, doing research,
or participating in advisory panels in Japan; and a high level of awareness of Japanese research
in their research areas.

	<b><a name="T8">Caveats（附加说明） on Data and Analysis</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The information we collected from our respondents is necessarily subjective, as it is based on
personal experiences, observations, and impressions about the quality of the scientific research
system and research results produced in Japan. This is something RAND and the sponsor recognize
from the outset, and, per the objective of this study and intent of our sponsor, this is not
considered a problem. Nevertheless, we proffer a few caveats to our readers.
First, the expert input we received typically addressed conditions within the narrower
scope of a respondent’s specialized research areas rather than for the whole field or the major
category to which a field is assigned in this study. When comments address Japanese science
education overall, for example, we make that explicit.
Second, comments by our respondents might reflect their experience of a particular time
and place. Consequently, two experts in the same research area can have vastly different experiences
and opinions. Such differences of opinion are reported without any attempt on our part
to query the reasons for their divergence or to reconcile them, as the latter is not the objective
of this study or a mandate by our sponsor.
Third, minority viewpoints are treated with the same respect accorded to majority viewpoints
in our reporting here. The fact that something was mentioned by a majority of respondents
does not necessarily make it more valid than something that was observed by only one or
two respondents. Also, our sponsor is interested in the full range of viewpoints and experiences
rather than what is the consensus or majority.
Fourth, again, we do not assess the validity of the information provided to us by our
respondents. The objective of this research is strictly to collect expert feedback and summarize
it in this report. Particular viewpoints, statements, or experiences expressed by our respondents
may deserve additional investigation to ascertain their validity and potential ramifications for
Japanese government policy. However, the focus and resources for this research do not permit
us to undertake such additional investigation.
