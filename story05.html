Summary 31<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): ICT; Computer science, applied (2)<br><br>
Location: U.S.<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent recalled that Japan was at the leading edge in work on fuzzy logic in the 1980s
but that, over time, Japan has lost this leadership. With its emphasis on application over theoretical
research, he said, Japan has produced some very impressive results in terms of putting
the technology into products and is very good about designing products that are attractive and
meet consumers’ needs and expectations. It has, however, not pushed fundamental research
further. He said that Japan might have chosen not to engage in more-fundamental work on
fuzzy logic because it decided to move on to other topics. Today, Chinese researchers, in his
opinion, are doing much more-basic work in this area and publishing far more papers, even if
the quality is not necessarily high.<br><br>
He suggested that perhaps it is Japanese culture or the mindset of Japanese people that
makes that them so good at emulating, borrowing, and adapting technology. He described
Japan as being very open to learning from others, taking what is good or useful, and making
it better and using it. Japanese people were also observed to be very meticulous. All this makes
Japan very good in engineering, but not in theoretical research, which compels one to ask why
instead of what. So, the respondent said, he was not surprised to see few new technologies
in his field coming out of Japan, even though Japan is a major producer of related consumer
goods. Japan, in his opinion, is probably the most change-oriented society in the world, but it
lacks originality and creativity to produce fundamentally new things.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
The respondent believed that the Japanese might lag behind even further if nothing changes.<br><br>
Technology used to be more about hardware, at which the Japanese can excel, but the current
direction is toward advancement in software (information processing), at which the Japanese
are not quite as good.<br><br>
Japan’s lack of English proficiency may be another weakness and, in his view, it is exacerbated
by the Internet, which is English-dominated. Without proficiency in English, Japanese
researchers are not contributing information to the global community of researchers. Already, he said, Japanese researchers do not seem to publish much in the top international journals―
which are largely in English―and are not engaging in discussions or collaborations over the
Internet. So it is as if Japan is not even on the scene or visible at all these days.<br><br>
Regarding independence, creativity, and innovation, he said, there is such demand for
consensus and uniformity in Japan (noting that research teams in Japan even dress in uniforms)
that independence and creativity are compromised. The Chinese, he said, are eagerly
learning English, hosting conferences in China in English, publishing in top English-language
journals, and going overseas to conduct research and for education. The Chinese, in his opinion,
have some way to go to catch up, but they are moving ahead. In Japan, where “the good
of the society comes way ahead of what’s good for the individual,” there is no innovation, and
this, he said, is a fundamental value difference that might explain why Japan is not good at
innovation.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
The respondent offered no recommendation. Instead, he queried why the Japanese government
is seeking to build strength in basic research when Japan’s nature might lead it to excel in basic
research. Further, he queried why Japan should aim to be like the United States or any other
society in what it does in S&T, as well as why Japan does not stick to what it does well―that
is, engineering―and aspire to do even better.<br><br>

Summary 32<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): ICT; Computer science, applied (3)<br><br>
Location: U.S.<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>
Gender: Female<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Low<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
In her field of networking, the respondent highlighted the Akari project, a Japan-wide project
supporting the future Internet, as a key research initiative. For this project, Japan was said to
be interacting with researchers in Europe and the United States and seeking collaborations
with foreign researchers. The project team, we were told, seems to be informed about activities
elsewhere in the world and is using this knowledge to determine how it can make unique
contributions.<br><br>
While she was not aware of any specific, recent notable accomplishments in Japan, she
commented that the University of Tokyo and Keio University were doing noteworthy work.
Top researchers in Japan, in her opinion, include Jun Murai, who is considered the father of the
Internet in Japan, and Kenjiro Cho, whom she regards as doing interesting work.<br><br>
While Japan does interesting work like the Akari project, the top countries in networking
are the United States, the UK, France, and Germany. She thinks that a particular strength of U.S. research is the tight relationships with innovative start-ups and connections with industry.<br><br>
This may be the case because the Internet originated in the United States. In contrast, Europe
and Asia may have an advantage in the wireless and cellular network fields. Being smaller
countries, expanding cell-phone coverage is easier; thus, cellular phones gained a larger role
earlier in these smaller countries.<br><br>
In the United States, she noted, there is a great deal of support for people building things
(e.g., writing code, building equipment). The availability of financial resources required for
large projects allow researchers to “try stuff out and let it evolve over time” to see how ideas
work in practice and make the necessary alterations. Undergraduate students are also trained
to be involved in these building activities.<br><br>
These types of projects are not necessarily better than other types of projects. Each serves
a purpose. For some problems, such an approach is indispensable. For example, with the Internet,
one does not know whether something will work until it is put into practice. One needs
“to try it out, interact with real users.” The respondent cited a U.S. National Research Council
study on how to judge research in computer science that states that, in general, the United
States highly values work that involves “engineering,” building, then testing. The problem
with this approach, in her view, is that it takes a long time to build and deploy and that these
activities would not happen if incentives were structured solely around numbers of journal
publications.<br><br>
Over the past 15 years, with the rise of these larger projects, she said, there has been an
evolution toward accepting a lower paper output as well as toward valuing conference papers.
In contrast, in Asia, many researchers are judged only by their journal-publication output,
which discourages large projects.<br><br>
One downside to these large projects is that they can be anti-intellectual. She said that it
is important to also examine the research findings using rigorous theory when large projects
are good for identifying important problems and seeing how things work in practice.<br><br>
Germany, she said, is an emerging country in the field. Its approach includes creating
focused institutes (e.g., at the Max Planck Institute) and running weeklong computer-science
retreats with people from around the world. She added that Germany is building its programs
and attracting high-profile people, including German expatriates. The country is able to attract
these individuals by making positions highly attractive in terms of resources. For example,
in Germany, a position might come with funding for students. Thus, one does not have to
spend much time writing research proposals to fund students. In the United States, low grantfunding
rates, in her view, compel professors to expend much of their time writing proposals.<br><br>
She clarified that competition for support is not entirely a bad thing, as long as funding
mechanisms can provide sufficient evaluative scrutiny. It is also important that researchers be
judged in other ways, such as by peer evaluation. However, junior faculty members need a
launchpad at the beginning to get their research going. If their resources are based only on the
number of funded grants they have received, launching their research would be more difficult,
since there is usually less success in obtaining funding early in a career.<br><br>
European countries, she reported, consider networking a “hot topic” and are putting
resources into it. In the respondent’s view, because Europe and Japan feel they are lagging, they
are investing more now in research and experimental infrastructure. She said that the United
States is putting fewer resources in because it feels more comfortable and less pressed to do
better in the field and because of the current financial crisis. <br><br>

The United States, however, is strong in human capital. Although visa restrictions have
made it more difficult to enter the United States, foreign students, in her view, coming to
the United States still represent a major talent pool. As other countries are developing better
research programs, there is now more competition for students. Many of these potential students
now have good opportunities to work in their home countries rather than going to
graduate school in the United States. She remarked that American students tend not to go to
graduate school in engineering; rather, most pursue careers in which the financial rewards are
promising (e.g., industry, finance, and professional schools). Fears of outsourcing also negatively
affect the numbers of people entering the discipline.<br><br>
In American culture, she said, technical graduate degrees are not highly valued. The
United States needs to cast technology in a positive social light to help change this. For example,
women, who are still underrepresented in computer science, should be shown that technology
is a way to connect with people.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?
Young faculty in Japan were viewed as having a difficult time getting started and were not
as “protected” in research with lighter teaching and committee loads as their peers are in the
United States. With fewer professional obligations, young faculty can spend more time on their
research, learn how to get funding, and learn how to deal with students. The respondent said
that it is critical for young professors to be very productive in the early stages of their career to
“get off on a good foot.” Quite the contrary, young faculty members in Japan, she said, “have
to pay [their] dues,” and they receive less mentoring to ease the learning curve. Young faculty
members in Europe face similar challenges.<br><br>
Some minor obstacles to foreign collaboration include the language barrier but also that
foreigners are not sure what professional behavior is appropriate. The respondent said that not
knowing how to behave might make collaborations difficult.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
The respondent’s comments speak to issues in the field at large and in the United States in particular
in some instances. Her recommendations might be seen as applicable to any country
striving for scientific excellence rather than strictly for Japan only.<br><br>
Undergraduate students should be encouraged to perform independent science projects.<br><br>
Their excitement for their research may spur them to consider graduate school. Undergraduate
research should therefore be encouraged or even be made mandatory. Also, youths might be
motivated to pursue research careers if they are aware that they would own the intellectualproperty
rights for their work (true in the United States) and they could leave academia to
pursue start-up innovation enterprises. Such departures from academia, in her view, can be a
good thing, as turnovers in academic positions provide opportunities for the next generation
of young researchers.<br><br>
Prerequisite courses for computer-science and engineering degrees should also be made
more widely available. Some high schools do not even offer physics, which renders students
ineligible for engineering programs. When students do not even know what computer science
and engineering are actually about, they are less likely to choose them as academic majors.
Making engineers more visible in the popular media (e.g., as characters in television shows in
Pakistan) might also help to encourage more youths to take an interest in the profession.<br><br>

Junior faculty programs could also provide a longer-term initial grant so that individuals
are more able to take risks on their first large project. Support for postdoctoral research is
declining in the United States. Without the extra training that postdoctoral fellowships provide,
young researchers would be less able to conduct ambitious research projects. Postdoctoral
experience, she said, also helps young scientists to mature and prepares them for academia.<br><br>
Finally, in her view, industrial research laboratories are at the very tail end of their “glory
days.” This means that students will have fewer internship opportunities and researchers will
have less industry exposure. Long-term industrial research is especially important and might
be encouraged through tax incentives.<br><br>

Summary 33<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): ICT; Computer science, applied (4)<br><br>
Location: U.S.<br><br>
Status: Rising star<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Moderate<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that research in the United States is far superior to that in other countries
and that all of the top centers of excellence and training in the field are in the United States.
Strength is growing in India and, to a lesser extent, in Brazil and China. In the case of India,
he believes that Microsoft’s research presence is helping India.<br><br>
The respondent could not think of any innovative research highlights for Japan. He
noted, though, that he was impressed by the sheer size of a large-scale Japanese project in which
Japanese researchers and an Internet service provider collaborated to measure how people were
using the Internet in their homes.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?
In his experience with a Japanese research laboratory, he thought, skills for “problem selection”
were lacking. So while the Japanese researchers worked with high proficiency, the problems
they picked were uninteresting.<br><br>
As for mentoring students, the respondent said, it could be challenging for non-Japanese
researchers considering the more-formal sense of seniority that prevails in Japan and most
other Asian societies.<br><br>
Finally, language could be an issue. Without a certain level of proficiency in English, it is
hard for Japanese students and researchers to work well in international collaborations. Laboratories
outside Japan might not find it rewarding to accept Japanese students or collaborate
with Japanese researchers when they cannot communicate and contribute to the exchange of
ideas and show they are making a fair contribution to the collaboration. Having proficiency in written English is not enough; researchers must be proficient in spoken communication as
well, because it is in impromptu discussions that ideas are often generated.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
The top institutions in the world all support a “culture of research.” Funding is important, but
it will not accomplish anything without the right research culture to think about science. Success,
he said, “feeds itself,” in that successful faculty members are those who have “absorbed
the model” and new entrants learn from them and absorb that culture by being immersed in it.<br><br>
Productive collaborations and exchanges are essential to improving research programs. To
be successful, these exchanges need to be appealing to both visiting and home researchers. The
home researcher will perceive a benefit if there is a financial incentive and good research is produced.
Countries that want to send their students to visit laboratories overseas need to prepare
their students before their departures so that they can make a useful research contribution.<br><br>
Researchers work together, our respondent said, if they can see potential benefits. For
example, a very positive ongoing collaboration for him started when the best student from his
collaborator in Germany visited the United States. The German professor took steps to make
sure the process was smooth and placed no restrictions on the student’s activities while in the
United States. The student did good research and, upon his return to Germany, was asked to
recommend another student he thought would work out well in the U.S. group. Exchanges
have continued, establishing a chain of students visiting the United States and reinforcing the
relationship between the two groups.<br><br>
Exchange programs can be risky, especially if the lengths of stay are long and there is little
prior knowledge of the quality of the visiting researcher. It would be better if students could
visit a laboratory for a couple of weeks at no cost to the U.S. researcher. The U.S. researcher
could evaluate the student and decide whether it would be beneficial for the student to stay
longer.<br><br>
Another way to improve collaborations would be for Japan to convince successful Japanese
expatriates to build connections back to Japan. They would not necessarily need to return
to Japan, just “build bridges.”<br><br>
Such collaborations and exchanges can be especially helpful to developing the proper
approach to scientific thinking, such as for identifying important research questions. To learn
to excel at research, he believes, one needs to be around people who know how to choose problems
and observe how they do it. Good researchers can pick their problems strategically and
articulate what they are trying to achieve and why, setting the research question in a larger
context. They can map out the goal posts and the possible routes to get there. Most researchers
outside the United States are not as good in thinking critically like this, especially those
in Asia. One way to remedy this may be to begin with reading introductions to cutting-edge
papers, which explain “not just where the research is going to go but why we should care.” In
fact, in his graduate classes, he uses this method to teach his students, questioning them why
papers are significant in a broader context. Then he follows with direct contact with researchers
who are able to look at problems critically; personnel exchanges between laboratories can
facilitate this.<br><br>
At the student level, encouraging open discussions and an open-door policy among faculty
might help, and informal mentoring by putting new students in work spaces in closer
proximity to more-experienced students may also help. Such informal exchanges would allow immediate feedback from mentors to help students learn how to think critically about research
problems.<br><br>
Then, for those students who are writing proposals or submitting papers, comments from
reviewers can also be helpful to sharpening their skills in critical thinking.
Finally, a high level of proficiency in English is essential. This view is shared by this
German collaborator, who has gone so far as to make English the language of his research
group in Germany.<br><br>

Summary 34<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): ICT; Electrical and electronics engineering (1)<br><br>
Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Low<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent did not rank Japan among the top countries in his field, or at least, he said,
Japan is not as “visible” as one would expect from a country of its size. Further, Japan is not visible
in his subfield. His assessment of Japan’s performance was based on the quality of Japanese
research papers in major journals of his field (e.g., those published by the Operational Research
Society and the Power and Energy Society).<br><br>
Knowledge of microeconomics, mathematics, operational research, and electrical engineering
were said to be essential in his field. Thus, researchers in his field cannot be experts in
only one area. Countries doing well in his field are those that emphasize this combination of
fields in their graduate programs―for instance, Sweden and Brazil. Germany is making progress,
too, but he does not know what policies are responsible for their improvement.<br><br>
Ultimately, the ideal model for his field, he said, is found in the United States. Students
in the United States are free to choose courses to provide them the necessary multidisciplinary
background. The European system is rigid and burdensome when students try to take courses
outside their own department. Some exceptions to such conditions occur at institutions in
Eastern Europe or Russia, but U.S. universities are still more flexible.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
The respondent commented that, even if Japan is doing great research, the rest of the world
does not know it, because Japanese researchers do not publish in the leading journals. As an
editor for some journals and having organized conferences, he reads a wide range of papers
and meets many people. The Japanese research papers he has read are high in technical quality
but poor in English and editorial quality. He also has not encountered any Japanese in Ph.D.
programs outside Japan at his institution or other places he has visited.<br><br>


By comparison, Chinese researchers, he said, are much more visible (e.g., researchers from
Shanghai University have shown dramatic improvements in their English language proficiency
and the technical content of their work in the past two to three years). He also finds Chinese
researchers eager to contribute to growth of the field by publishing, attending seminars, and
engaging in activities to identify research questions and find answers to them.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
Japan’s efforts, in his view, should be focused on human capital. Computers are essential, but
they can easily be purchased. Fostering human capital, however, will require Japanese researchers
to interact more with the rest of the world. More Japanese should go overseas for their Ph.D.
training or to do postdoctoral research. Japan should also bring non-Japanese to Japan to
teach and conduct research in Japan. Japanese researchers must learn not only technical skills
but also how research activities are organized, how questions are framed, and how interaction
between students and faculty is carried out.<br><br>
Since Japanese research is currently so invisible to the world, the first step would be to
open up to rest of the world to show what Japanese researchers are doing and the quality
of Japan’s graduate programs. Complementing this would be a policy to encourage Japanese
researchers to publish in the top journals and attend more conferences and seminars internationally
and to expand relationships with individual researchers and countries that are at the
frontiers of knowledge in the field.<br><br>

Field and Subfield(s): ICT; Electrical and electronics engineering (2)<br><br>
Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Rising star<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: High<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that Japan is quite strong in his field of carbon nanotubes. A major
research group in Japan is led by Summio Iijima, who was said to be the first scientist in the
world to observe carbon nanotubes using an electron microscope, in 1991. Iijima, said the
respondent, controls significant funding and has additional research teams working under
him. Other high-caliber professors leading strong groups are Marinobu Endo, Hisanori Shinohara,
and Yoshio Bando. The respondent named Hiromichi Kataura, Dmitri Golberg, Shigeo
Maruyama, and Ryuichiro Saito as additional prominent researchers in the field of carbon
nanotubes working in Japan.<br><br>
In fact, the respondent said, the world’s leading experts in carbon nanotubes are in the
United States, the EU, and Japan. However, the best papers and technologies come from the United States and Europe, even though Japan has very good equipment (e.g., electron
microscopes).<br><br>
The respondent estimated that about 300 people conduct nanotube research in Japan but
that only 20 are internationally renowned as leaders. By comparison, he estimated, Europe has
about 40 of the world’s top nanotube researchers and the United States has 50, including many
young faculty members who are also quite well known and with stronger publications than
their peers in Japan. In this connection, he observed that the average age of nanotube researchers
in the United States is about 40 versus 55C60 in Japan.<br><br>
Notable institutions in Japan, according to the respondent, include NIMS and AIST,
adding the observation that few researchers from Europe and the United States work at these
institutes despite their being very well funded.<br><br>
In his view, Japan is much more efficient in performing research that leads to the development
of technology devices. Japanese researchers can obtain significant support and work on
ideas that come to them externally, mainly from industry. AIST, for instance, receives considerable
industry support from companies, such as Sony and Toshiba. Research projects at AIST
usually are funded at levels five to ten times higher than is typical in Europe.<br><br>
In this connection, it seems researchers Japan are far more focused on applied research―
perhaps 90 percent focused on developing devices―versus the United States and Europe,
where researchers are more interested in discovering new phenomena.<br><br>
The respondent sees positive changes in Japan. He cited the Japanese Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology’s (MEXT’s) center-of-excellence program,
which provides funding to Japanese universities to create centers that (each) pursue a five- to
seven-year project with about 20 professorial positions and recruit scientists from Europe and
the United States to work at these centers. This reflects an opening of Japan, but these are still
projects of short durations, so the majority of foreign scientists will leave Japan when the project
is completed.<br><br>
Research infrastructure in Japan is perhaps more advanced than in other countries due to
the availability of public funding and support from industry for research and commercialization
of results.<br><br>
As for the quality of students in Japan, the respondent thinks that their knowledge of
theory is quite comparable to their peers in other countries. The quality of education, on the
whole, depends on the caliber of the university. Thus, he found students from Tokyo University
and Tokyo Institute of Technology to be very strong, and reported that those in the engineering
department may be even stronger.<br><br>
In his view, Japan’s higher education system is reasonably good on average. Master’s of science
programs in Japan may be even better than those in the UK; it takes six years to complete
a program in Japan versus four in the UK. These additional years allow students to acquire
more practical knowledge. He credits the yearlong assignments to research organizations as
particularly helpful to increasing students’ practical knowledge. Typically, he explained, in the
fifth year of a student’s master’s program, the student would interview with companies and be
offered employment. This leaves students to focus on their research in the sixth (final) year―in
particular, to conduct research that relates to their future work and acquire the specific knowledge
to prepare them for their new jobs.<br><br>
The respondent had a positive experience in Japan from the start. He chose to go to Japan
because he personally found Japan a very attractive place. Also, he considers the JSPS fellowship
he received as one of the best in the world in terms of salary, research and travel support, and the opportunity to attend conferences in Japan. Although funding was more restricted for
individual researchers to purchase materials and equipment, his research team as whole was
well supported. He also had access to new equipment.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
Japan, on the whole, is not an attractive place for non-Japanese researchers. While Japan may
be attractive―both professionally and personally―for a short duration of a few years, establishing
a long-term career and life in Japan for non-Japanese is rather challenging. Language is
a fundamental problem. It may be possible to learn enough Japanese for communication at a
basic level, but attaining proficiency for communication at a professional level and writing academically
are very difficult and time-consuming. Another difficulty is the social environment.<br><br>
Knowledge and practice of Japanese customs are important in the work environment, and the
work structure is very hierarchical. He explained that solving a problem means going to the
supervisor, who then passes you on to the secretary of the head of the group. The secretary then
arranges for a meeting, and only then can you put forward your request for help.<br><br>
Another problem of doing research in Japan is that research groups do not openly communicate
with each other. At his institute, for example, each research group receives money
from a different set of companies or government sources. Consequently, there was a high level
of secrecy about what they were doing and who was paying for the work. As such, he finds the
research environment less open to the free flow of ideas and said that research groups are more
focused on pursuing money for their own work than on exploring new ideas and collaboration.
When comparing funding per paper citation in his area of research, the UK spends ten times
less than Japan but has more citations.<br><br>
In this connection, the respondent believes, there is less creativity in Japan than the
United States and the EU. When researchers can more openly communicate with each other
and not be given topics on which to work by their superiors or industry funders, they are freer
to explore and exchange ideas. At the University of Cambridge, for example, researchers can
pick up ideas from a range of open sources, including conferences and journal publications,
and take them further.<br><br>
Also, in his experience, the Japanese research community―like Japanese society―is a
“quite closed circle.” He cited as an example that Japanese researchers in his field seem to put
more weight on their participation in two local symposia in Japan and communicating their
research within these forums than within the research communities outside Japan.<br><br>
Also, researchers in the United States and Europe can generate spin-offs from their
research―something Japanese researchers cannot do as easily. In Japan, research results are
owned by the research institutions. It is the institution that would transfer patents to industry,
which would conduct the final evaluation and production.<br><br>
As for the education system at the doctoral level, the respondent finds that institutions
like his in the UK to do a far better job in recruiting the best students from across the world;
they conduct courses and research in a more open environment than in Japan. For an institution
like AIST, the absence of a graduate school and having only a few research scientists also
mean a less productive environment for the average postdoctoral fellow.<br><br>
Another problem is the strict hierarchy system in Japan. The dependence young researchers
have on their older colleagues and their relative lack of freedom in research negatively affect
the quality of their work. Thus, he finds Japanese postdoctoral fellows to be generally inferior
in quality to their peers from Europe and the United States.<br><br>

What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
At present, some Japanese S&T policies aim to foster international collaboration, using such
mechanisms as fellowships. Most non-Japanese researchers stay up to three years because establishing
a permanent career and life in Japan is too challenging for a longer period.<br><br>
Also, there is limited support for international collaborative projects. He knows of only
two or three agencies―with JSPS being one of them―actively promoting international collaborations
(e.g., making non-Japanese researchers an essential element in their work). This is
not enough. Japan needs to become more open and create real opportunities for international
projects, such as getting involved in research programs in the United States and the EU.
Finally, overall, he recommends that the Japanese government direct resources to encourage
creative, innovative work. This ultimately would benefit the Japanese economy.<br><br>

Summary 36<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): ICT; Mechanical engineering (1)<br><br>
Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Moderate<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
There are good institutions in Japan, some of the world’s leading experts, and some major
accomplishments in the area of mechanical engineering. However, the respondent could not
cite them off-hand during the interview.<br><br>
He found that, in the past, under certain circumstances, Japan’s ability to determine goals
and executing a long-term strategy to achieve them in a ten- to 20-year period has proven to
be a strength. Japan appears willing to commit to plans that may take ten or 20 years to execute
and achieve a goal, like becoming world leaders in creating electronic compact discs and
making “made in Japan” a sign of quality by the 1970s. By comparison, European countries
might have plans for the next five years, or the United States for an even shorter period.<br><br>
The danger of using long-term plans is, however, that these plans could become outdated.<br><br>
Thus, in the United States, plans may last for as little as three months. Since the future is
becoming increasingly unpredictable, such short-term plans may be more flexible in responding
to anticipated and unanticipated changes.<br><br>
He also found significant improvement in infrastructure at industrial laboratories in
Japan over the past 20 years. He suspects that Japanese government support might have helped
to make the difference and that professors, who are required to retire from faculty positions at
65 years old―like in Austrian and German universities―take up positions at private-sector
laboratories after their retirement (e.g., a Japanese colleague of his went to work for Hitachi
Corporation).<br><br>

The respondent stated that he does not know enough about the Japanese education system
to comment on it, although he has had five or six Japanese graduate students working under
him and all were very good. The main problem in working with them is their lack of proficiency
in English.<br><br>
He has seen stronger interaction between Japanese universities and industry in the past
ten to 15 years. However, as a non-Japanese working outside Japan, it is hard to know the relationship
between universities and industry in Japan. In Munich, he said, a great deal of emphasis
is now placed on creating “spin-offs.” In the United States, too, professors would leave their
university jobs to exploit business ideas.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
When working with Japanese researchers, the language barrier is a prominent issue. The living
environment in Japan, too, can be challenging for anyone considering study or research in
Japan. The language problem, small living spaces, and other factors make Japan less attractive.
A friendlier living environment in the United States motivated him to attend graduate school
in the United States and to accept a job from a U.S. university. This may explain, in his opinion,
why most European students who come to the United States to study choose to stay for
work as well.<br><br>
Bureaucratic burdens are also greater in Japan (and Europe, too). By comparison, there is
less bureaucracy in the United States (and more emphasis on individualism).<br><br>
Finally, Japanese researchers work long hours but do not seem to be very efficient compared
with their peers in the United States, who work fewer hours.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
The respondent emphasized that his recommendations are based only on his experience, and
he cautioned against generalizations or jumping to conclusions.<br><br>
First, giving space to creative research is important, and so is having high-quality researchers
and good infrastructure. Good funding is, of course, also critical. For those whose research
is closer to industrial research, industry money would be important. For those involved in basic
research, public funding is essential.<br><br>
On research organizations, both networks of small research institutions and larger centers
are necessary.<br><br>
Relaxing the hierarchical culture in Japanese research, in his view, would also be important
if it is not serving the country in educating the next generations of scientists or providing
services to industry. Universities in the United States have a much more open environment,
and professors and students can more freely communicate.<br><br>
Such a research culture, exacerbated by language problems, in his view, has made it
extremely difficult for non-Japanese researchers to fit in. This, in his view, explains why no
European or American researcher has managed to build an academic career from the beginning
in Japan.<br><br>

Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Moderate<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
In her field of computational logic, she said, there are very good people in Japan. Based on her
experience, she said, there is good international collaboration with Japanese researchers, with
the latter seeming to have adequate travel funds. Her collaboration with Japanese researchers
began with email exchanges and mutual visits, and she characterized the collaborations as “very
open.” Although the respondent believed that the system is very hierarchical in Japan, she did
not personally have that impression when visiting and working with her Japanese colleagues.<br><br>
In addition to having some very good researchers, Japan was also said to be publishing
a lot in her area of research. This, she explained, is a good demonstration of the quality of
research in Japan when it is the individual researcher rather than institution size or equipment
that drives the work in computational logic. Several top people were named, including
Gaishi Takeuchi (retired), Hiroakira Ono (at JAIST), and Yuichi Komori (at Chiba University).<br><br>
Younger professors, such as Kazushige Terui (at Kyoto University) and Makoto Tatsuta
(at the National Institute of Informatics, or NII), were also mentioned.<br><br>
The respondent said that several Japanese institutions appear to be well funded and able
to fund monthlong visits of European researchers. Nevertheless, there are other institutions,
such as the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications, that are barely able to sustain themselves.
Some of the leading Japanese institutions include JAIST, NII, and the Research Institute
for Mathematical Sciences at Kyoto University.<br><br>
In her own country (Austria), the respondent lamented that internal university funding
in her field is very limited. In fact, the university has few publicly funded positions. The two
key research grant sources are the Austrian Science Fund and the Vienna Science and Technology
Fund. These two institutions, she said, do not limit their awards to specific topics. Awards
are given to creative proposals, and grant amounts can be between 200,000 and 300,000 euros
for up to two years.<br><br>
Having no in-depth knowledge of Japan’s educational system, she did not comment on
its competitiveness vis-a-vis other countries. She was aware, however, that Japan has a strong
tradition of mathematics. Where the European system is concerned, she rated it as superior to
the American one because, in her view, the former emphasizes day-to-day studying while the
latter is driven by tests. Thus, the European system produces students with a better mastery of
concepts and skills.<br><br>

What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
She said that researchers would work where they can find an outstanding level of research,
infrastructure and access to equipment, and a nice and friendly environment inside and outside
the university. For foreign researchers, both professional and personal lives in Japan could
be challenging because they are not Japanese. Such adversity, she said, might explain why a
number of her colleagues had spent only short periods in Japan.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
First, support basic research. In economic times like this (global financial crisis), basic research
frequently suffers cuts when policymakers choose to emphasize applied research.<br><br>
Second, help young researchers to launch their careers. Assistance, in her view, includes
creating a friendly environment for them and having good mentors to guide them. She stressed
that mathematics is not dependent on equipment and is somewhat less competitive than other
fields. This makes mathematics a more open community intellectually, and collaborations can
more easily occur when researchers do not require expensive equipment or access to facilities.<br><br>

Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Low<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent named the United States as the best country in his field of mathematics, with
Germany (specifically, the Max Planck Institute) and Japan (specifically, the University of
Tokyo and perhaps Kyoto University) as being other leading countries. He saw China as likely
to build strengths in mathematics but said that it is currently lagging behind the top countries.
He said that Japanese researchers have been working in the field of bioinformatics for the
past 15 years. Japan, in his assessment, is very good at this applied side of his area (i.e., applying
algorithms to computer science), but it is not as good in new mathematical developments.<br><br>
Japan’s other strengths relative to the other top countries include its human capital (e.g., Japan
ranks at the top in international high-school science and mathematics tests, such as PISA and
TIMSS-R). Japan also has very good funding levels, hardworking people, and a relatively
stable economy. The country is also highly ranked in its teaching capacities in terms of infrastructure,
funds, and human capital. In comparison, the United States needs to import graduate
students, while Europe struggles with funds and Russia with its economy.<br><br>

What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
Japan’s relative isolation and self-sufficiency might be its greatest challenges, according to the
respondent. Even though Japan is very much developed in his field, he has never seen opportunities
to collaborate with Japanese researchers. The respondent noted that there is little collaboration
between Japan and his country and that there is no tradition of working together
in developing Ph.D. programs or research endeavors. “There are no Japanese students in my
country, while you see a lot of Chinese people in and out of the campuses.”<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
It is important to build networks. Japan, the respondent emphasized, needs to build more in
this respect even as it has greatly improved in the past decade. An example to follow is the
Erasmus student-exchange network that aims to foster graduate students’ mobility.<br><br>
For any country, he said, the key to a successful mathematics and science policy is to
encourage scientists to be researchers as well as professors. Professors need to be hands-on
researchers and expose their graduate students to research from the very beginning. Exchange
initiatives, such as Erasmus, could help to mitigate these difficulties and challenges in collaborations
due to differences in cultures and approaches in the same field.<br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent ranked the United States as the top country in mathematics. France would
follow (the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), then Germany (the Max Planck
Institute), and, finally, Russia, even though it has “lost its critical mass due to convoluted
politics.” He said that he was clear how Japan compares with other countries. In general, he
thought, Japan is doing well, though not at the frontier of the field. He thinks of Kyoto University
as competitive in the field and as doing good research. Two decades ago, he would have
expected Japan to become a leader in the field today. However, in his view, Japan’s performance
has been disappointing in the past 20 years. In his own experience and those of his colleagues,
Japan is a very expensive place to visit and live. Also, English is the “official language” in academic
interactions, but Japanese is indispensable for more in-depth interactions.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
Tradition, he stressed, is important in mathematics, and time reinforces the strength of an
institution. In his opinion, it is very difficult for any university, institution, or country to gain strength in the field without such a history or tradition in the field. In the case of Japan, such
a tradition is lacking, so, he said, he considers it very unlikely that Japan will become a leader
in the field.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
There is “no unique solution of how to organize and fund a successful scientific system,” he said.
Decentralization works well in the United States, while centralization works well in Russia and
France. Russia, he noted, has a solid and sustained policy of investment in math- and sciencerelated
human capital that has lasted many decades.<br><br>
Unlike other areas, he said, mathematics does not appear to have useful commercial applications
for which synergistic links to industry would be useful. In fact, he said, the financial
world can attract qualified people away from research in mathematics. Those left in research in
math are people whose ambition is not driven by money. So a good environment that fosters
innovation and a reasonable salary may be sufficient to attract math researchers.<br><br>
His advice to any country wishing to build strength in mathematics would be to pick a
subfield and attempt to build a tradition around it. A single country, especially a small country,
cannot lead in all subfields. Another approach might be to create a number of institutions
with “different levels of sophistication.” This, he said, helps to explain America’s success. With
opportunities to combine academic training and subsequent professional work, people with
different skills could find places to stay and grow professionally.<br><br>

Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Moderate<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
Japan was seen to have improved a great deal in basic chemistry during the past two decades
by doing the right things―specifically, sending people abroad and paying them to come back,
giving incentives to firms to invest in fundamental research, and encouraging collaboration
with European and American researchers. The respondent considered Japan to be second in
the world behind the United States, and followed by Germany, with results published in the
top five journals of the field. The University of Tokyo, Tsukuba University, RIKEN, and Osaka
University were cited as examples of quality research centers in Japan. The respondent was also
aware of some Japanese researchers who have won Nobel prizes. He said that he expects Japan
to remain near the top of the field.<br><br>
In his view, funding and connections with industry are definitely strengths of the Japanese
system, and far ahead of Europe. He compared these with his experience in European countries, such as in Belgium, where, he said, it took a lot of effort to make connections with
firms to get funding for both applied and theoretical research. In Europe, funding arises from
individual initiative, with no official policy aimed at encouraging people to do so. In Japan,
however, firms invest in theoretical research. He believed that it has been Japanese policy in
the past five to seven years to provide public funding to private-sector firms for theoretical
research. Although, he said, he is not aware of the specific instruments involved, he knows that
firms have to compete for such public research funds. In this connection, he said, Japan is a
leader in commercializing research because of strong links between fundamental or theoretical
research and firms.<br><br>
Japan, he said, is also very competitive in terms of infrastructure, administrative support,
and travel support, especially when compared with the situation in Europe. He also ranked
Japan highly in quality and quantity of human capital. He highlighted improvements in English
language proficiency. In the past, he said, Japanese researchers hesitated to speak for fear of
embarrassment if they did not reply accurately. With improved proficiency in English, he said,
he found that Japanese researchers are more able to communicate.<br><br>
In his view, he said, the centralization of national policies in Japan has worked well to
coordinate different actors on infrastructure and funding and to provide guidelines.
He said that he strongly believed that Japan’s strength in S&T is also due to the high
regard its society has for scientists, thus making it attractive for people to pursue scientific
careers.<br><br>
As for visits to Japan, he said, he would not be daunted by the higher cost of living in
Japan, as he knows that professionals are properly compensated.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
One problem is the aging population. Japanese society has a problem with aging in general,
and this will affect its scientific and technological activities. Japan is aware of the problem and,
to some extent, has tried to cope by hiring foreigners, even Chinese researchers. However, he
said, he does not see too much future in this approach of using Chinese researchers because of
historical tensions between the two countries. Specifically, he said, he does not expect Japan to
put the development of the fundamental areas in Chinese hands.<br><br>
The second problem, in his view, is the lack of interest among Japanese youths in the
research professions. He said that this is a worldwide phenomenon and not unique to Japan.
Young people value “soft professions” that might yield high pay. In the case of Japan, he said,
when young researchers generally work under senior researchers as their subordinates rather
than pursuing their own research interests, the most-driven ones might choose to go overseas.
Third, he said, “it is very difficult for a European to adapt to such a different society
[Japan].” This foreignness of Japan to non-Japanese researchers might prevent them, including
the respondent himself, from going to Japan to conduct research.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
In his opinion, both short- and long-term priorities are set in Japan, and they are fine. Japan
simply needs to sustain what it has done so far and try to address its weaknesses.<br><br>
The ideal S&T system, he said, would combine the leadership of the United States and its
faith that everything can be solved, the creativity of the European system, and Japan’s systematic
approach to science and the hard work of Japanese researchers. <br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that Japanese researchers do some very high-quality nanotechnology
research. However, he regarded it as “not the most earth-shattering research but the next level
down.” Japan was rated as being in the middle among the top ten nations in nanotechnology,
with little change in its competitiveness in the field in the past five years. Although Japan is
investing in the field, the respondent noted that other countries, too, are investing. Also, this is
a quickly developing field, so others are catching up. The top country, in his view, is the United
States, followed by Germany, Switzerland, South Korea, and China.<br><br>
Much of the top Japanese research in nanotechnology is instrumentation-based. As such,
his pick of the top Japanese institutions are NIMS, RIKEN, Kyoto University, Osaka University,
and the University of Tokyo. All other Japanese institutions, he said, rank at a substantially
lower level. Among the top Japanese scientists in the field, he names Masakazu Aono,
Akira Tonomura, and Kunio Takayanagi.<br><br>
Although Japanese nano-scientists have highly sophisticated equipment, he said, he is
uncertain whether the volume or number is adequate. Research groups at universities in Japan
do not appear to have much success in commercializing research results. He surmised that this
is partially due to a culture that does not incentivize individuals. When an entire department
may have to put its resources behind a commercialization effort for the research results of one
or a few individuals, the individuals might not have the support of the group. Japanese companies,
in contrast, are very aggressive and successful in protecting their intellectual property.
This relatively strong division between academic and industry research, according to him, is
reminiscent of the old model in the United States.<br><br>
He said that he is aware that Japan has been trying to improve the quality of its research
and collaborations (e.g., at NIMS and the World Premier International Research Center [WPI]),
by giving more opportunities to young researchers to think independently and creatively―
skills that are essential to research success. Also, he cited Japan’s large financial investment in
the WPI initiative as an example.<br><br>
However, he emphasized that breaking out of cultural patterns is not easy, so, in many
cases, it is a “lot of talk but not much change.” He said that he has great hopes for the center
and that it looked like there would be strong potential to work with Japan. However, there has
been little collaboration in practice. He attributed this outcome to excessive caution. In contrast,
a training program in Denmark took the risk of recreating the system from the ground
up, and big changes have helped to make Denmark competitive. He said that the aversion to
risk hinders Japan from dramatically increasing its research competitiveness.<br><br>


What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
First, he noted that the Japanese are trying to encourage collaborations through WPI and
JSPS. However, in practice, these efforts have not always lived up to the aspirations of the
planning stage. For example, in discussions with scientists in Japan, he said, he and his colleagues
had planned on using English as the default language of collaboration. However, many
conversations ended up taking place in Japanese, which meant that scientists lacking fluency
in Japanese (such as himself) were left out of the discussion. He also observed that Japanese
collaborators often wanted the researchers in his own laboratory participating in the project
to be American rather than other nationalities. Such discrimination may also be driving away
potential international collaborators.<br><br>
The culture of Japanese laboratories might also hinder collaboration to some extent. He
said that he finds many Japanese researchers lacking enthusiasm in scientific research. He also
observed a much stronger division between personal and professional lives in Japan than in
North America, which can sometimes feel strange to foreigners. For example, he said he was
rarely invited to the homes of co-workers or got to know co-workers as individuals.<br><br>
The social structure in Japan could also be an impediment to high-quality research. In his
experience, he said, there are individuals with power who can do anything they wish. He also
observed that students entering a laboratory are guaranteed a job upon exit by their supervisor.
Thus, he thought, they have less motivation to perform well at their tasks. If this were changed,
he said, students would become more motivated. He said that he also found that students were
rarely very enthusiastic about their work and were more focused on getting published in highvisibility
journals, such as Science and Nature, than on doing high-quality research for its own
sake. High-impact papers should not be the only indicator for good research. An emphasis on
paper-driven research might be an artifact of the reward system as well as pressure from laboratory
heads.<br><br>
Finally, he said, it is substantially more difficult for women to be active in high-level science
in Japan. There are few women in positions of power, and they are paid less for performing
the same job. In his experience, women were also shut out of some social gatherings. In this
manner, Japan is missing the “power” of half its population.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
In the respondent’s experience, he said, Japanese students currently do not challenge each
other, as students do in the United States. For example, in his research group, students take
responsibility for discussing and debating their research and the literature. In Japan, the filter
is primarily at the entry point. Once researchers pass this point, they are guaranteed that
their supervisor will find jobs for them. Their independence as researchers is also constrained.<br><br>
A diminished feeling of competition results, and they become less motivated to learn and
improve. In the United States, there is competition for success at every level. This, the respondent
stressed, encourages individuals to improve, which collectively improves the situation for
everyone.<br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent ranked Japan’s work in his field as comparable to the best work in Europe,
and noted that he has “a very high opinion of Japanese universities and industry.” He did not
think that the United States was very strong in applied chemistry. He named two companies,
Mitsubishi and Hitachi, as leaders in his field and said that there are “excellent universities” in
Japan, but he could not name the specific institutions. He explained that research in his field
has been moving from basic to applied work and that the best work in Japan occurs in the
private sector rather than universities. He ranked Japan a leader in other fields, too, such as
photovoltaics and microelectronics.<br><br>
In his opinion, Japanese researchers are “very quick,” filing many patents, even on less
innovative things to ensure that they are guarding the space surrounding other inventions, or
so that a competitor cannot harm their product. U.S. firms were seen as less inclined to file patents,
which would require them to publish their work. With knowledge in the public domain,
others can make modifications on their work and file new patents, which might bar the originating
company from using its products.<br><br>
The research infrastructure in Japan was described as “good to excellent.” Human capital
in Japan, he said, is suffering the same problems as in U.S. universities 20 years ago. Specifically,
average student motivation is decreasing (e.g., “nowadays you don’t see them working
[into] the night as in earlier times”). At least the top students still seem to be driven and committed.
But, in general, students are less motivated and are driven to finish up quickly so they
can earn more money outside of university. The respondent reported seeing the same tendency
in China, noting that, when teaching there a few years ago, over 100 highly motivated students
would attend his lectures. More recently, the audience is much smaller. He said that the
organizers explained to him that attitudes are changing in China. With improved living conditions,
motivation has fallen and interests shifted.<br><br>
In his view, universities in Japan, the United States, and Europe all face similar bureaucratic
problems. He noted that, when he visited the United States to conduct research, the individual
research funding he received created a “complicated” immigration and tax situation.<br><br>
He characterized Japanese industry research firms as well managed and said that there
is a strong feeling of “belonging” to the company. This, in his view, benefits the company and
should be supported in the workplace. In Japanese universities, too, he described professors as
gods, but they were seen to treat their students very well, and everyone is friendly and respectful
to each other.<br><br>

The respondent said that he does not know much about the funding structure in Japan,
but he thought that research funding was becoming more political everywhere. For instance,
the EU Framework Programme allows the people writing proposal requirements to apply for
funds, thus giving “the feeling it is a kind of mafia.” Researchers who are awarded support are
also not always the best ones. Similar tendencies in program funding was said to be true in
other programs in Europe, the United States, and China.<br><br>
He said that the quality of Japanese education is comparable to that in Europe and the
United States and is much better than that in China, Singapore, India, and Indonesia. Among
Asian countries, he ranked Japan and South Korea at the top. In his own experience, he said,
he has had several Japanese postdoctoral researchers who are “excellent,” hardworking, and
who “listen to you and try to do the best they can.”<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?
In his view, the Japanese have a closed mentality, which always makes “real collaboration” a
problem. Also, the Japanese like to have a strong feeling of “belonging” to something, which
can be the family, the company, or the Japanese society as a whole. This may have positive
implications, such as that Japanese researchers, after dinner, go back to continue working at
their company, but he said that negative implications are also possible. For example, in his
experience, a researcher at a company seems far more reluctant to share information than his
or her peers in other countries. The politeness of Japanese people, too, can make it difficult to
communicate with them.<br><br>
Finally, in his experience, most Japanese do not have good mastery of English. Japanese
people, as with other Asians, face language barriers because “the structure of their language is
completely different [from] English or other European languages” so that it is extremely difficult
for them to learn good English. Although Japanese scientists now command superior
capacity in English, which helps in most communications, high-level information exchanges
(e.g., writing for journal articles and presenting at conferences) remain very challenging for
Japanese researchers. He said that he observed that researchers belonging to some larger European
countries, such as France and Italy, also lack proficiency in English compared with their
peers from smaller countries.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
He said that it is critical to promote original research in an unbiased fashion. Proposals are
often evaluated by experts who may be too close to the research. For instance, reviewers might
be friends and help each other out, or they may be enemies and would attempt to kill the proposal.
Switzerland has a good system in this regard that the Japanese should consider adopting.<br><br>
He said that the research proposal must be submitted in English and is sent to at least one
outside (non-Swiss) reviewer to make the funding process more independent and unbiased. He
said that this might be initially difficult for Japan, because young researchers would have to
write their proposals in English. In the long run, he said, requiring them to do it in English
will strengthen their English capabilities.<br><br>
He also recommended a preference in funding for individual research ideas because they
can be most innovative. Ideally, the largest funding amounts, he said, should go to fund innovative
individual ideas. Right now, in his experience with reviewing proposals, he noticed “a
preference for proposals that fit into some framework.”<br><br>


Another way to encourage creativity would to be guard against “inbreeding.” Early in
their careers, scientists should change locations multiple times. For instance, the Ph.D. program
at University of California, Berkeley, gives preference to people entering with master’s
degrees from other universities and admits only the most-outstanding master’s degree graduates
from the University of California, Berkeley, into the Ph.D. program. Basic research, he
underscored, requires new ideas, which are most easily generated by the “refreshment of your
head” that comes from change. The best system is therefore one in which people obtain a master’s
degree at one university, get a Ph.D. at another, and then go to yet another university for
an assistant professorship. In the respondent’s ideal career path, one would change locations
four or five times before one turns 45 years old and then remain in the same place for the subsequent
20 years.<br><br>
The question of what would constitute the best education depends on the goals of the
system, he said. Some countries might choose to produce a smaller number of top researchers,
while others might prefer to produce a larger number of graduates able to work in industry. To
do both, universities need to provide mass education as well as Ph.D.-level education. To train
outstanding people, he said, there needs to be “special treatment for top individuals who have a
creative idea.” The best universities also have the most critical evaluation system for appointing
professors. While not all professors can be excellent at any given university, it is the top performers
who make the difference. These individuals set the standards for teaching and research<br><br>
and produce thoughtful students.

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
In organic chemistry, the respondent named the top countries as the United States, the UK,
Germany, and France. Japan, she said, is in a good position, but “one might have expected
something better.” She noted that Japan is very competitive in catalysis and perhaps at the
forefront in this specific area.<br><br>
She said that these countries stand out not only because of sufficient funding levels but
also how they allocate funds to spur high-quality research and support physical infrastructure.<br><br>
She emphasized the necessity of pushing scientists and researchers to be competitive and to
publish in the main journals in the field. For instance, she mentioned that the United States is
uniquely competitive with its combination of an openness to discuss ideas, its graduate education
system, and its large size.<br><br>

The respondent named Ireland, Finland, and Denmark as doing well and catching up to
those at the forefront. Ireland is promising, she said, having progressed a great deal since the
1970s and particularly in the past decade or so, due to the leading role played by government.
She commented on its varied public policies, which range from strong human and infrastructure
investments to the introduction of tax incentives for the private sector. Collaboration was
said to be aggressively promoted between researchers inside and outside of Ireland and with
researchers in private-sector firms (mainly pharmaceutical companies).<br><br>
She stressed, however, that Ireland, Finland, and Denmark are small countries whose
policies could not necessarily be extrapolated to Japan. The respondent did not know Finland’s
policies in detail, but, with respect to Denmark, she insisted that money played a role but that
tremendous efforts also went to improving its Ph.D. program and the quality of its faculty.
One of Japan’s strengths, in the respondent’s view, is its graduate education. She commended
Japan for its investment in human capital, increasing the quality of its Ph.D. programs,
and fostering collaboration with institutions and researchers in other countries at the
undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctorate levels.<br><br>
While the respondent did not single out any specific institutions or researchers in Japan,
she remarked several times on the high quality of Japanese Ph.D. graduates. Japanese postdoctoral
researchers are also very well trained and “very detailed” in their work.<br><br>
Finally, she said, she is seeing Japan opening up, as reflected by the increased number of
Japanese students going to the UK for postdoctoral work, and she cited agreements between
Japanese firms and research centers in Ireland.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?
Based on her experience collaborating with Japanese students and researchers, she said, the
main weakness in Japanese research is its overemphasis on applied research.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
Any country that wishes to be at the forefront of the discipline must first invest in physical
infrastructure. She added that the quality of education at all levels must also be improved,
both by bringing in high-quality faculty and by “raising the bar for students and researchers.”
Increased investments in ICT and promoting collaborations, through guidelines and funding,
with leading countries or the private sector would also be helpful. Such actions in the
EU exposed a large number of students and researchers to new ideas. Finally, quality must be
emphasized over quantity. She counseled a “focus on excellence [and] to invest in the best science
and in the brightest people.”<br><br>

Summary 44<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): Nanotechnology and materials science; Materials science, metals (1)<br><br>
Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Rising star<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Low<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that the field of materials science is too broad to say that there is national
leadership in the entire field. Within specific areas, there are researchers in Japan doing highquality
work (e.g., in battery research, along with Korea, which is ahead of Europe and the
United States). So, in his view, there are some renowned Japanese experts with international
visibility, and he thought that Japan was well represented at conferences, especially relative to
its population size.<br><br>
In terms of Japan’s research capabilities, he said, Japan is competitive in the quality of
equipment and amount of research support. The respondent said that he thinks that Japanese
researchers are paid good salaries, which, from a financial perspective, can make Japan a more
attractive location for a postdoctoral fellow than going to, say, the United States. In his view,
researchers in Japan have access to excellent equipment, more so than their peers in Germany
or maybe even the United States. However, for foreign researchers working in Japan, life may
not be the same as for Japanese researchers. The respondent opined that there appear to be two
systems for researchers in Japan: one for Japanese and one for foreigners, with the latter generally
excluded or left out on their own.<br><br>
On improving the quality of education in Japan, from his perspective as a professor, he
said, he would focus on cultivating academic excellence, even if it means having a smaller
group of highly motivated students. Such students would ideally begin laboratory work as soon
as possible to integrate them into creative scientific work.<br><br>
Looking at the U.S. experience, the respondent said, U.S. professors are generally excellent,
but the U.S. system does not necessarily produce exceptional students. In his research area
(materials science), he said, his students in Germany are better trained than their peers in the
United States. He attributed this to a better and broader education system in Europe that takes
in a large number of students but weeds half of them out, leaving only the best to complete
their studies. By comparison, he said that the U.S. education system is more tailored to the
individual student’s interests and does not impose on them a broader educational experience.
Further, he said, U.S. students are less “internationally mobile” than their peers in Europe.
For example, the respondent reported that a significant number of students at his university in
Germany go to France, the Scandinavian countries, the United States, and even China for part
of their academic training. This is something rarely seen among U.S. students.<br><br>
The respondent said that he has the impression that, in the past few years, Japan has been
putting a great deal of resources into establishing elite, internationally known institutions in
the materials science field that would be attractive to international experts. However, when it

fails to attract the world’s leading experts to come to work in Japan, the country invites them
to sit on expert advisory boards.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?
The respondent said that, in spite of its financial resources and excellent laboratory equipment,
Japan does not have enough qualified staff (both technicians and students) to maintain and
handle equipment and that it is generally difficult for young researchers to build a career.
Also, he said that the pattern in Japan’s research emphasizes “quantity” rather than “quality.”
Japanese research groups were said to be highly hierarchical, sometimes with some 50 to
60 people working under one professor. The respondent took the view that it is not possible
for a single professor to maintain adequate scientific oversight for such large groups. Also, ultimately,
a strong hierarchical structure is counterproductive for creativity.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
The respondent stressed that Japan must increase its human capital and dismantle the “counterproductive”
hierarchical structure that discourages creativity. One option might be to increase
the number of international research collaborations to reduce the “island existence” for Japanese
researchers. Such collaborations would target researchers and students and would include
travel support.<br><br>
He noted that Japan already seems active with programs and activities designed to attract
international experts to Japan. He said that there are several similar programs in Germany and
the United States. For example, the German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer
Austausch Dienst) has signed bilateral agreements with a number of countries. Another
example is the Materials World Network of NSF in the United States, which provides money
for common research projects between U.S. and international materials-science researchers. In
this network, each participating country agency is responsible for funding its own researchers.
Such schemes may be superior, he said, because they nurture relationships to produce
excellence in research. Creativity, too, must be nurtured, and creativity is about allowing individual
ideas to come forth and be tested―which, in the case of Japan, may be hard to achieve
because Japanese society values the group over the individual. Japan, he emphasized, should
consider how to support people who think “outside the box.” Such nonconformist thinkers or
“freaks” can be especially important in the basic sciences because they dare to do things no
one else believes in.<br><br>
Depending on its focus, he said, centrally planned research is neither always possible nor
fruitful. The respondent commented that the prevailing trend in the United States, and more
recently in Germany, is to support large, interdisciplinary projects with research questions
established by policymakers and often large and international research teams. As an example,
he noted that, in the United States, funding mechanisms provided by NSF generally support
large collaborative projects, while funding for individuals is practically nonexistent. In his
opinion, these projects generally do not show a large return on investment in the form of scientifically
exceptional results. Also, their huge structures are not manageable, which means lower
productivity. The respondent suggested that it would be much better to have smaller teams of
people who choose to work together because of a shared research interest.<br><br>
Therefore, the respondent said that a key question for S&T policy is how to support independent
researchers with creative ideas. He pointed to a new European initiative, the ERC,
which funds unconventional ideas from researchers who have already proven their competence and expertise, as well as to a Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) program for research<br><br>
ideas outside predetermined research topics. He highlighted that these funding approaches that
respect and promote intellectual freedom are much more promising than having policy makers
establish research priorities (as it was with nanotechnology and now energy). The respondent
also cautioned that topic-driven funding should not be completely abandoned but that, especially
in basic research, there must be room for individual creative thinking.<br><br>
He underscored that it is generally important for researchers to conduct research based on
their own ideas and on the approach they perceive as most promising, even if they fall outside
program-oriented funding structures. Productivity and creativity need to be promoted, and scientists
should have the freedom to establish their own framework. In this vein, the respondent
stressed the importance of recruiting young rising stars and promoting inter national mobility
for students and researchers.<br><br>

Summary 45<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): Nanotechnology and materials science; Materials science, metals (2)<br><br>
Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Rising star<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Low<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
Japan is definitely competitive in his area of research, especially in some specific subfields,
said our respondent. He described recent advances in his field as fairly evolutionary, such as
advances in multiscale modeling, the possibility to treat longer scales in the case of bigger systems,
and continuous improvement of computer codes and algorithms. The respondent said
that the only recent project from Japan that attracted his interest is OpenMX. Looking further
than five years back, the respondent mentioned the Earth Simulator in Japan as having significant
impact and that Japan’s contribution is mainly experimental, such as making electrons
visible at the end of the 1990s. The respondent said that there are a few very good people in
Japan, although a highly qualified wider research pool is lacking in his specific field of expertise.
Nevertheless, he cautioned that Japan might be stronger and possess better institutions
beyond his specific field and that therefore his opinions must be understood within this context.<br><br>
Also, the respondent commented that Japan is doing well in attracting the research community
by holding conferences at which top people are presenting. Regarding the quality of
Japan’s education, the respondent said that he was not very familiar with the Japanese education
system and so he could not adequately comment on it.<br><br>
In his view, most of the top researchers in his field are in the United States, Germany, and
the UK, and they have made significant advances in his field in the past five years. The UK,
for instance, managed to catch up with the former leader in his field by increasing its research capacity through increased funding and having many more good young researchers contributing
to the field. Also, Italy and Denmark were said to be quite competitive, too.<br><br>
Among the leading institutions in Germany, the respondent named the Forschungszentrum
Julich, the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in Berlin, and several universities.
In the UK, the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and the London
Centre for Nanotechnology were said to have been very successful in attracting highly qualified
people, especially from within Europe. In the United States, the leading institutions were
said to include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and Northwestern
University.<br><br>
On the future of his field in the next five years, he said that the strong countries will likely
remain strong with their improved infrastructure and that he expects no significant change in
the international rankings.<br><br>
For Germany, specifically, its educational system (though good) would benefit from a
stronger integration of theory and practical research, as is presently the case in the United
States and the UK. The current German education system, in his opinion, is too formalized.<br><br>
Students, he said, go through a great deal of theory without linking it to practical research
until they begin their dissertation work. Then, once they are in their dissertation stage, they
are thrown into doing practical work without accompanying theory. Also, instruction is too
formal, with little personal interaction in the initial phase of graduate school, changing only
after students enter the dissertation stage.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
First of all, Japan lacks a highly qualified pool of researchers in his field. Perhaps this is a language
issue; perhaps they are not as well trained. Good infrastructure and good people typically
occur simultaneously―as in the United States and the UK―but, he said, he was not
certain that this was true for Japan.<br><br>
Second, he said, he has the impression that it is difficult for foreign researchers to be
integrated into Japan’s work system. Individual decisions, he underscored, are driven by the
attractiveness of a country’s overall research environment, including the funding opportunities
available and respect for independent research, in addition to having highly qualified students
and the possibility of tenure. When foreign researchers going to Japan are offered only temporary
positions, it does not make Japan a very attractive place to pursue a career. Then, there is
the living environment in Japan, which might be a less attractive option for foreign researchers.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
First, he said, Japan should improve its professional and social landscape to make the country
more attractive to foreign researchers. To encourage international research collaborations,
Japan must open permanent positions to foreign researchers. It must also have a broad and
highly qualified pool of researchers and students, good funding opportunities, and an attractive
living environment to appeal to researchers and their families.<br><br>
Second, Japan must provide access to facilities (e.g., high-performance computing centers).<br><br>
Europe has been relatively successful in overcoming barriers tied to where researchers
live and work. But, he stressed that “infrastructural networking” in the EU provided other
benefits, such as increased openness, better exchange of information, and stronger research
networks. For researchers in Germany, the major funding sources are the Max Planck Institute,
national funds (e.g., the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and DFG), and the EU. The EU, in particular, he said, has promoted networking and collaboration across 
national research communities.<br><br>
Third, having a variety of active small groups that can work independently is more productive
than having a strongly centralized “big father” telling them what to do―this, he said,
is his impression of Japan.<br><br>
Finally, to improve the quality of education, it is important to begin with broad study for
about three years, then allow for deep specialization. He said that students must be led to the
frontiers of knowledge in their area of specialization. They need to see where current knowledge
stops and where new questions appear. Further, students should have maximum freedom
to select their specialization and access to high-quality researchers, and researchers need access
to high-quality students. This access to top people may be a bigger attraction than money.<br><br>

Field and Subfield(s): Nanotechnology and materials science; Materials science, metals (3)<br><br>
Location: U.S.<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: High<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that Japan has done extremely well in producing groundbreaking work
in metals materials science. For example, he cited three researchers connected with Nagoya
University who won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Two of the three winners, Toshihide Maskawa
and Makota Kobayashi, completed their postgraduate training at Nagoya University, while
Yoichiro Nambu completed his postgraduate training at the Imperial University of Japan and
subsequently pursued advanced studies in the United States. Thus, he believes, “clearly they
[Japan] must be doing something right.”<br><br>
In his opinion, the seven former imperial universities are the best in Japan. Number one,
by far, is the University of Tokyo. Kyoto University, Osaka University, and Tohoku University
could all belong to the second spot. Kyushu University is lower down, perhaps sixth or seventh,
but, he said, “it is still way better than the private universities.” He noted that Akihisa Inoue
at Tohoku University is the most cited researcher in the field. However, Inoue was recently
appointed president of the university. This, the respondent stressed, is a classic example of a
productive person being taken out of research and put in an administrative position, saying,
“this is the end of his [Inoue’s] career as a researcher and that is a great loss for Japan.”
The respondent also described Japan’s S&T capacity as “excellent” and “superb.” Japanese
laboratories were said to be very well equipped. Japan’s strength is also reflected by the fact
that Japan is a major developer and manufacturer of all the equipment everyone uses. He said
that electron microscopes used at U.S. laboratories are all manufactured in Japan, and all by
the same company (JEOL Limited). Japanese companies, he said, all make superb equipment. <br><br>

The respondent also said that Japan’s method of funding programs is “far better than the
way it goes here in the U.S.” MEXT, he says, does a good job in allocating Japanese government
funds to laboratories, particularly those at the former imperial universities. Each department
receives block grants that are divided up among the researchers, so the base level of funding
for each professor is very good and provides a stable source of research funds to researchers,
who can also apply for additional outside grants.<br><br>
S&T training in Japan was also described as very good and at a very high level, and the
Japanese government has done a lot to improve it in the past five or ten years.<br><br>
The respondent does not think that there should be any policy-priority changes to increase
international collaboration. Japan, he said, is excellent at encouraging collaboration, and “there
is nothing they can do better.” He added that it is extremely easy for international researchers
to work in Japan. There is an abundance of funding opportunities (e.g., JSPS gives study and
research awards for use in Japan). Researchers do not need a visa for stays of 90 days or less, so
short visits are easy where immigration is concerned. He also said that the people are friendly.<br><br>
He said that he simply “cannot think of any way this situation could be improved.”<br><br>
The respondent said that he has been to Japan “a tremendous number of times” and also
teaches there from time to time. All the time he has spent in Japan would probably account
for more than three years of his life. He noted that he had taught a materials-science class in
English but that students were not particularly prepared for a class in English. The situation
was fine at the University of Tokyo, where students speak English well and always ask thoughtful
questions in English. At Kyushu University, however, he said, English proficiency among
students is quite poor. At the end of the class, when he got his reviews back, invariably about
half the class was very enthusiastic, saying that he did a great job, that he was excellent, that
he spoke slowly and was understandable, and that the exercise of learning in English was very
important. The other half of the class, however, would comment that they were at a Japanese
university and therefore should not have to take classes in English, that they did not understand
a word, and that the whole exercise was pointless.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
He highlighted three main problems with S&T in Japan. First is the “horrendous” lack of
female participation. In the classes he taught, he said, there were usually about 60 students, of
whom only two were female. These female students would sit silently together at the very back
of the classroom. There are virtually no female professors, aside from a couple of women here
and there who come from China. Japan, in his opinion, is losing half of its workforce because
it does not encourage women in science. This is a serious issue, especially in a country where
the workforce is already diminishing due to a small and aging population.<br><br>
This, he said, is in stark contrast to China, where women are well represented. Since
China has so many female scientists there, some of them invariably come to Japan and do
well. However, Japanese women do not get that far, and the few Japanese women who go into
science at the undergraduate level would leave Japan for Ph.D. programs overseas and never
come back, especially if “they’re any good.” The female postdoctoral fellow he has running his
laboratory, for instance, is now married with family in the United States and would not return
to Japan.<br><br>
The second biggest problem (although much smaller than the absence of women in science)
is the compulsory retirement age. Most public universities have a mandatory retirement
age of 63. At the University of Tokyo, it is 62 years old. According to the respondent, “when you retire you’re out, you’re completely gone, you have nothing more to do with the university.”<br><br>
This is in contrast to the United States, where professors can convert to emeritus status. He said
that these retired scientists in Japan “are just finished, even if they were at the height of their
productive research years.” They do not leave for other countries because they want to remain
in Japan, so they teach at private universities, which have a later retirement age of around 70.
However, these are teaching positions only, and the professors do not conduct research. This
policy can therefore cut out many years of productive research.<br><br>
Lastly, there is no understanding that people may wish to devote their entire careers to
research. He said that, when researchers reach a certain career point in Japan, there is “considerable
pressure” to go into higher-level administrative positions at the universities. As with
the compulsory retirement age, this is a “very short-sighted” policy that cuts people out in the
prime of their research careers and results in an enormous amount of lost productivity. The
respondent noted that many of his friends have been in this situation and are very unhappy
about it. These colleagues, he said, have to accept the administrative assignments even if they
do not want to.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
He believes that the lack of females in Japan’s S&T is “absolutely the number one problem and
it trumps all other problems. There is absolutely no encouragement given to women, and this
needs to be rectified.” He believes that changes must be made through MEXT to encourage
minorities to engage in S&T.<br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
“Japan is absolutely competitive” in his field of research, said the respondent. He cited Japan’s
invention of carbon nanotubes, though adding that other countries have produced groundbreaking
research since and that today the United States is the leader in carbon nanotube
research, followed by Japan and Europe. Japan, however, continues to produce the mostdetailed
and -difficult work when the highest technical capability is required. Japan is also the
leader in microscopy.<br><br>
According to the respondent, the key Japanese researchers in these areas hold prominent
positions and have good access to funding. Some of the leading institutions in these areas
are the Meijo University, the University of Tokyo, the technology cluster in Tsukuba, and
NIMS―all of which the respondent has some familiarity with. <br><br>

The respondent believes that Japanese research infrastructure is also at the top end, having
likely better equipment than the top U.S. institutions, and this is especially true in microscopy.
Also, the respondent said that his impression is that it is not too difficult to find money for
research or travel in Japan.<br><br>
In terms of management and organization of research institutions, he said that the United
States might be better than some European countries, such as Italy, for example, where it can
take up to two years to get a grant approved and often the award is only a small portion of
the full amount needed. In the United States, he said, feedback is much quicker, grants provide
sufficient money, and oversight on how grant money is spent is done “with a light touch.”
However, he noted that grant applications to NSF in the United States can take much longer
to process than applications in Europe. In particular, he emphasized that preparing research
proposals in the United States could be very time-consuming, since proposals can average
about 60 pages in length. In contrast, the national grant applications in the UK are about six
pages in length.<br><br>
The respondent said that he could not comment on Japanese science education. Regardless,
he said, he believes that the United States has the best educational system in the world.
Although undergraduate education in continental Europe is more challenging, takes longer to
complete, and gives students a deeper knowledge than the system in the United States (and
Britain), the system in continental Europe puts less emphasis on connecting experiments and
real-life problems. The U.S. and British systems also give students more hands-on experience.
Then, in graduate training, he said, a Ph.D. program in the United States is longer (five years
versus three in the UK), which allows more time to enable better training. However, he said, he
has faith that the British system will improve. For example, new programs are becoming more
like the U.S. system, requiring four years to complete with the first year focused on practical
knowledge and training.<br><br>





Another advantage of the U.S. universities, he said, is that, when researchers are hired,
they receive a starter grant to launch their initial research and, if good results are produced,
they will have access to additional funding. He contrasted this with Europe (including the
UK), where there is no starting funding, which makes it very difficult for young researchers to
launch their careers, even though access to funding might be easier once they have established
their credentials. For instance, in Germany, the respondent explained, one gains significant
access to staff and funding following appointment as a full professor.<br><br>
Over the next five years, the respondent said that he expects no significant changes in
national leadership in his area of research and that countries that are currently strong will
remain on top. He did mention, however, that competitive players might emerge in some areas.
Research institutes in India and Saudi Arabia, Chinese universities (e.g., Peking University and
Shanghai Jiaotong University), and a private firm in Russia are all building human capital and
infrastructure to be active players in nanotechnology and materials science.<br><br>
The global financial crisis, the respondent speculates, may be slowing the out-migration
of researchers from India and China to places like the UK, where graduates may more likely
choose to stay in academia than work in the private sector. Their decision to pursue a research
career might even be a catalyst to a larger share of high-level researchers coming directly from
U.S. and European universities. Finally, he said public-sector funding for research, too, might
become more important when private industry is hurting a great deal from the global financial
crisis.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
“There is nothing wrong with the Japanese system and institutions, per se,” said the respondent,
based on feedback from colleagues who have worked in Japan. He said that his own
experience with Japanese researchers has also been positive. However, in his experience, older
Japanese researchers tend to be a bit formal, and Japanese themselves function within a very
formal structure. He said that the groups with which he has worked are deliberately mimicking
the more informal structure and communication style that are common in the United States,
but probably not all research groups in Japan are doing this.<br><br>
As for Japan’s research performance, the respondent said, he expects more than what he
sees, given the superior funding and equipment available in Japan. In Europe and the United
States, researchers have less and lower-quality equipment, but they produce more in quality
and quantity. This led the respondent to conclude that Japan has managed to keep up with
Europe and United States because of its superior equipment and that there is room to improve
human capital in Japan.<br><br>
As for Japan’s effort to internationalize the domestic research environment, Japan’s environment
and culture (including language) may be simply too alien to European and American
researchers. Programs like the Toshiba fellowship are quite attractive, but making a career and
building a life in Japan can be quite challenging. Most European researchers in Japan return
to Europe after stays of two to three years. By comparison, moving within Europe or to the
United States is easier.<br><br>



What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
The respondent said that he could not speak for Japan specifically. In general, having the
right funding structure is critical to promoting excellence in research. Researchers in Europe
and the United States are often required to demonstrate that their research has applied uses,
which might necessitate collaboration with an industrial partner to guarantee that the research
output will lead to a product. There should be support for much more “blue-sky research”
(that is, fundamental, conceptual, not tied to application) because it often produces the mostimportant
findings that are the foundations of scientific knowledge. He cited the establishment
of blue-sky grants by the Imperial College in the UK as a very positive step. Further, it would
be desirable if researchers could gain multiple research grants (in addition to initial grants) to
keep exploring a question if the initial funding allocated was not sufficient, instead of having
to apply for new funding with a different question.<br><br>



He said that it would be ideal if a certain amount or percentage of funds would always
be set aside to sponsor exploration of good ideas. Also, reducing the administrative burden in
grant writing (e.g., shorter proposals and no lengthy mandatory reports) would leave more time
for researchers to engage in scientific work. The publication of research results in peer-reviewed
journals and an accounting of how research funds are spent should be all that is required.<br><br>
Finally, there should also be more awards for individuals at the beginning of their careers, and,
as their credentials are established, access to funding should be eased. The respondent cited as
examples two recent British grants for graphene research that are about pounds 5 million each.<br><br>
The establishment of the ERC in 2008 and a new way of funding research also hold promise
for Europe. The ERC, he explained, provides up to 3 million euros in research grants over
five years for individual researchers and significantly reduces the administrative burden associated
with grant proposals. In the first year, 10,000 applications were received for 200 grants.<br><br>

This contrasts with the situation in the United States, where the administrative burden and
bureaucracy for research grants are much more onerous.<br><br>
Finally, international exchanges―that is, spending time overseas for training and research
collaborations―can be critical to improving S&T capacity. In the case of Japan, the respondent
noted that the best Japanese scientists have all spent a significant amount of time abroad.<br><br>

Summary 48<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): Nanotechnology and materials science; Materials science,<br><br>
semiconductors (1)<br><br>
Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: High<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that Japan is well positioned to remain a leader in surface research. Japan,
in his view, is also a leader (along with other Asian countries) in research on lithium-ion batteries
and has brought important new approaches to photovoltaic research.<br><br>
Overall, he thought, Japan is quite good in all interesting areas of materials science. He
cited several examples of Japanese innovations: amorphous crystalline silicon cells (by Sanyo);
injection cells (or semiconductor-electrolyte cells), in which electrolyte is substituted by gelstructured
polymer electrolyte; and the use of titanium-dioxide as a photo catalyst. He said
that all these ideas originated in Japan.<br><br>
But often when the initial idea did not originate in Japan (e.g., the lithium-ion battery,
which originated in the United States), Japan (in this case, Sony) has managed to turn ideas
into commercial products.<br><br>
The respondent said that the top institutions in Japan in his field include the University of
Tokyo and various public and industrial research institutes. Among the public research institutes,
he named AIST. Among the industrial research institutes, he named the Toyota Institute
of Technology, which he described as a “company university.” The difference between these
institutions, the respondent said, is that the universities have considerable financial resources
but relatively outdated laboratories and buildings, while the public and private research institutes
are very well equipped. As an example of the latter, he cited the laboratories of NTT near
Tokyo as the biggest and best equipped that he has ever seen.<br><br>
Where human capital is concerned, he said that Japan appears to have a wealth of it and
that research groups are well staffed.<br><br>
The respondent said that he believes that research success is strongly correlated with the
percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) invested into research. Europe, the United States,
and Japan all have a long history of investing in research. In addition, “professors” are highly
regarded in these societies, which also helps to recruit people into the field.<br><br>

Japan, in his opinion, was said to have a relatively high readiness to take risks in research,
as reflected by its investment in new systems. Japanese research was described as relatively
innovative and prepared to investigate unclear areas if the issues are interesting. By comparison,
he said, research in Germany is more risk-averse, and funding is provided more for topics
in which the scope is clear and other countries are conducting research.<br><br>
Finally, he rated Japan’s education as very good in assisting students in acquiring both
theoretical and experimental knowledge.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
In the respondent’s view, organizational structure in Japan is very hierarchical, and it hinders
creativity. People are assigned to follow up on ideas (along with regular “checking in” rituals)
rather than given time to be creative and follow up on their own ideas. The respondent compared
this with Germany, where groups are also organized around a professor but where doctoral
students and postdoctoral fellows enjoy more autonomy in their research approach and
more critical communication and compromise occur between senior and junior staff. In Asia,
the researcher with the longer experience is the master. He is assumed to know more about
everything and is expected to teach the young ones. As a result, younger researchers have less
autonomy and are not inclined to be critical of “old knowledge.”<br><br>
Another problem with this hierarchical structure is that the best and brightest are not
always the ones recruited. Typically, a retiring professor is replaced, or succeeded, by his preferred
“student,” who may or may not be well qualified for the position. The respondent said
that this makes the system less open to younger or more-critical researchers who think differently
from or question the established professor. However, one advantage of such a system, he
said, might be continuity in an investigative approach to avoid sudden changes according to
the latest “trends.”<br><br>
In this connection, he said, rigid structures and unwritten rules also seem to hinder non-
Japanese researchers from working in Japan. For non-Japanese, becoming a professor in Japan
appears to be more difficult than in the United States. When staying only temporarily in
Japan, researchers are not expected to learn how to operate within these structures and unwritten
rules. Although non-Japanese researchers may not be expected to know these structures
and rules, they cannot advance without learning them and learning to operate within them.<br><br>
In his own experience, he received a high level of cooperation when working with Japanese
colleagues. But, in general, the level of cooperation is greater when working with colleagues
in the United States and Europe. Japanese students and researchers, too, seem more
reluctant to go abroad, and Japanese students generally have lower proficiency in English than
their peers in Europe.<br><br>
Then there is also a kind of mindset among Japanese students who work very hard to sail
through the rigorous admission process of the leading Japanese universities. But, once they are
enrolled, they do not appear to want to apply themselves any more. He said that it is as if they
feel that good grades and graduation will just be awarded to them without additional exertion.
Not that Japanese students and researchers do not work long hours―they do―but they seem
to be less effective than their peers in Germany and the United States. He has seen students
and faculty falling asleep in his lectures in Japan and in staff meetings because people are so
exhausted by the long working hours, and such behavior seems to be condoned or treated with
empathy. In Germany, the respondent said, falling asleep in a staff meeting is unthinkable.<br><br>


Finally, Japanese education appears to have no critical distancing from the findings. He
has seen students and researchers draw conclusions based on preexisting knowledge without
critically questioning this knowledge. He said that this tendency toward thinking that “if it is
written someplace it must be true” seems to be a general characteristic of Asian countries (and
might be even stronger in China). In the United States and Europe, he said, there is a stronger
tendency to question. Such difference may be attributed to the Enlightenment in Europe,
whereas knowledge transfer in Asian society occurs within the context of a “master-disciple”
relationship.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
International collaboration will contribute to excellence, and international collaboration must
begin at the student level. Students, he said, need to be more proficient in English, and they
need to spend time overseas, if they plan to pursue an academic career. Inviting foreign lecturers
to come to Japan helps (e.g., activities sponsored by JSPS), but it is not enough. He insisted
that more Japanese researchers and students must go abroad. In Germany, he said, it is rare for
anyone to be appointed a professor without have spent some time conducting research abroad.
In short, international experience is a basic requirement.<br><br>
Further, it is people rather than institutions that are truly engaged in collaborative activities.
Hence, concluding more research agreements, for example, between institutions in Japan
and overseas is not enough. Japanese must go abroad. Yet, few seem to want to do it, and there
seems to be little incentive for them to do so. In Germany, for example, many projects need
postdoctoral fellows, and Germany does not have enough graduates to satisfy this demand.
He said that many Chinese postdoctoral fellows are coming to Germany to take advantage of
these opportunities. In fact, the respondent said, he now has six Chinese postdoctoral fellows,
as well as Russian and Indian researchers, in his laboratory. University programs in China and
India are producing high-quality researchers, and many are going to the United States and
Europe for higher salaries.<br><br>
As for the method of instruction, in his experience, training in theory and experiment can
occur in tandem. Students should experience the key concepts both theoretically and experimentally
and should also be encouraged to take a critical view on things, especially because
often research proofs taken as accepted knowledge are later shown to be wrong. In Europe, the
respondent opined, there is a tendency toward more-superficial university education, with less
of a clear distinction between in-depth and more-superficial education. This, he believes, is a
result of mass education, in which all are put through the same system instead of allowing a
distinction between those who want to go into depth and pursue an academic career and those
who prefer more-practical study. One should recognize that there are students with more or
less ability and differentiate. In Germany, the previous system assumed the earlier recognition
and differentiation of students with varying abilities by establishing two types of universities
(polytechnic and normal universities). In Japan, the respondent said, people know very well
which universities conduct in-depth studies and which focus more on broader, practical studies.
Similarly, he explained, in the United States, there is also a clear differentiation between the
top universities and other universities that aim at more-basic knowledge transfer.<br><br>
Finally, in terms of managing research, it is important to provide merit-based promotion
opportunities for young researchers.<br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that Japanese laboratories are very well equipped with state-of-the-art
instruments. He said that he is impressed by Japan’s intensive national S&T planning―in particular,
in selecting fields for increased funding. He said that having some 50 people from the
highest levels of industry and academia come together to participate in large councils to plan
new initiatives is simply not done in Sweden, where this respondent works. Further, decisionmaking
processes in these large councils in Japan appear to be quite efficient.<br><br>
In terms of significant accomplishments made by Japan in his field, the respondent said,
Japan now leads the world in high-temperature connectivity, even though much of the work
on this was done in the United States. Japan was also said to be strong in neutrino, materials,
microelectronics, and nanoelectronics research―all areas in which Japan has stayed in the
forefront but not as the world’s top leader. As for other fields in the basic sciences, the respondent
said, Japanese scientists appear to be well funded. For example, leading Japanese researchers
have large detectors for studying elementary particles.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?
Japan may be “too well equipped,” considering that it does not have enough human capital to
make full use of its high-quality facilities. In his experience, he said, when there are too few
technicians to maintain equipment, researchers must invest their time to set up experiments
and maintain the instruments―time that might otherwise be spent doing research.<br><br>
Similarly, the respondent said that, although he did not know too much about the management
of research organizations in Japan, he has the impression that administration is a bit
top-heavy in Japan.<br><br>
Other than this, the only weakness, he said, that is apparent to him is the inability of
Japanese researchers to critically question problems and issues. This inability, in his view, traces
back to weaknesses in training students to become critical thinkers at the college level. Also,
culturally in Japan, researchers hardly ever criticize or challenge their superiors. In fact, only
higher-level or senior researchers in Japan seem at ease with expressing criticism openly.
The respondent said that he had visited several laboratories in Japan for a period of several
months each and felt that his experience was fairly similar to exchange visits at institutions in
the United States and Europe. He did not conduct many experiments because his stays were
short and the instructions for equipment were all in Japanese.<br><br>
He said that foreign researchers could find it difficult to gain full acceptance as equal
partners in Japanese society at the professional and social levels. Perhaps, he said, this is a result of Japan being a rather hierarchical society and one not accustomed to assimilating foreigners
into its homogeneous environment. Personal relationships and networks, too, matter a great
deal. Here, again, foreigners in Japan are disadvantaged.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
Most fundamentally, Japan should expand access to full-time and tenure positions for foreign
researchers in Japan. He stressed that the system must decide how foreign researchers can meet
their teaching requirements if classes are conducted in Japanese. This may not be a big issue if
foreign faculty can teach in English and if Japanese faculty do not get preferential treatment in
picking courses for instruction.<br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that both individual Japanese researchers and Japanese institutions are
very strong in the field of theoretical physics. He reported seeing major advances in Japan in
his field, especially in the past five years. Japan, he said, has also established completely new
subfields. In all respects, he said, he considers Japan as on par with other leading nations, and
he expects this to remain the same in the coming years. Kyoto University and the University of
Tokyo were perceived as particularly strong. Visiting several Japanese universities a few years
ago, our respondent said, he found the experience very positive and was very impressed by the
facilities. He said that he has yet to engage in any joint research with Japanese researchers but
noted that one of his students is currently at Kyoto University and is reportedly enjoying the
experience there.<br><br>
He said that Japan is probably better positioned than other countries to attract young
people to work in science because the prestige of science has not deteriorated as much in Japan
as in most other countries.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?
The respondent said that it is widely known that opportunities for foreign researchers are very
limited in Japan. Thus, he had not considered an extended stay, like a sabbatical, in Japan. Further,
in his view, Japanese science is a closed community, and he did not expect it to completely
change in the foreseeable future. <br><br>

What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
He made no recommendations, emphasizing that Japan is well positioned in international
research in the theoretical science.<br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
Due to his lack of “experience with the Japanese situation,” the respondent said, he should
limit his comments to the situation in Europe. The problem with physicists, in his view, is that
they “mainly like to do what they do and to change that is really tedious.” In his own experience,
he said, he had a difficult time changing fields within physics. It has also been difficult to
get physicists to participate in industrial research. He said that European countries have been
striving to integrate research in universities and industries, but researchers in academia and
industry mistrust each other.<br><br>
The respondent said that he does not expect Japan to reach the forefront of the field in the
next five years. For high-energy physics, the best place to be is CERN (the European Organization
for Nuclear Research), on the border between France and Switzerland, and in Germany,
which has several high-energy facilities. Such infrastructure is absent in Japan, even though,
he said, there are “some nice facilities in Kyoto [University] but nowhere else.” He said that he
knows that Japanese researchers from different institutions visit CERN for their work.<br><br>
In the Netherlands, the respondent reported, a change in funding policy has provided
large sums of money to young researchers to build up their own research groups. This has
helped to attract young researchers to the country. Sustaining this as a long-term policy, in
his opinion, can be very beneficial to raising S&T capacity. His research group received funding
for a research program that will last more than a decade. Having secured such long-term
support, he said, his research team can better focus on research rather than writing grant
proposals.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
He stressed that scientists should not have to constantly compete for money. For example,
small research groups in Italy must “fight for the money,” unlike their peers in Germany, who
receive support from a centralized structure.<br><br>
Perhaps the lack of interest in overseas training and research experiences among Japanese
students and researchers might also be a handicap. The respondent noted that he has rarely seen nuclear physicists from Japan visiting his institution. This left him to question just how
“international” Japan is.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
The main thing is to have good scientists. Funding is necessary to educate them, attract them
to accept employment opportunities and stay, and support their research. In his opinion, when
a society does not value science, access to funding for science becomes more difficult.<br><br>

The respondent said that Japan has not been a significant player in gravitational wave physics
until recently. Coming from a place of “significant weakness,” Japan was said to be now at the
forefront and pushing to be a big player, but it is not yet a challenger to the U.S. leadership. In
the 1960s and 1970s, and into the 1980s, Japan was not a major presence in astrophysics, with
the exception of a few singularly good astrophysicists. Then, in 1990, the country was said to
“come out of nowhere” through the effort of a number of young people.<br><br>
The respondent named Seiji Kawamura the top Japanese experimentalist and said that
the University of Tokyo has been influential in the field through the work of its Institute for
Cosmic Ray Research. He said that another astronomical center just outside Tokyo has also
been doing very good work. Kyoto University was said to be a major player on the theory
side, and Japan was said to have “a handful of superb theorists.” The respondent also noted
strength at Osaka University. Some very interesting and important accomplishments were said
to have been made on the small scale (e.g., by individuals or by making very specific measurements).
For instance, the Japanese were said to be significant collaborators in the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), second only to the UK and Germany in
contribution.<br><br>
The leading countries were said to be the United States, the UK, Germany, and Russia
(at least a few years earlier, and it is expected to recover). Surprisingly weak, according to the
respondent, are Italy and France.<br><br>
The respondent also said that he is not sure how people can be educated to think creatively.
The American system, in his view, seems to be “clearly very good” at educating people
to think creatively, and the Russian system used to be as well. China has been improving in
this regard in the past decade. In fact, he noted that the “very best person in the field” is from
China and that he finds superb young Chinese scientists eager to return to China.<br><br>


What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
The respondent said that Japan appears to “have the organizational ability to pull off largescale
projects.” These projects were said to be organized “far more tightly” than large scientific
collectives in the United States, but they produce roughly comparable levels of success.<br><br>
He said that the Japanese system “does not seem to give younger people space to be brilliant.”
When they are doing something routine, he said, the Japanese approach is more effective.<br><br>
However, when branching into new areas, “there’s a problem with the Japanese approach.”<br><br>
He commented that even the Soviet Union allowed its brilliant young people to have significant
roles in innovation, despite centralized decisionmaking.<br><br>
The respondent said that he has had some superb young Japanese scientists in his laboratory.<br><br>
One of these, who returned to Japan, was “clearly one of the several very best people in
the world,” but, because of the structure of hierarchy in Japan, it would not be possible for him
to be a leader in Japan. In Japan, the respondent said, only those with superior political connections
and high prestige become leaders of laboratories.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
For people intending to perform cutting-edge research, it is important that “they have received
enough of the tools to explore ideas as they come along, but also have high creativity when it
comes to pursuing new ideas.” These, the respondent noted, are “the most difficult things to
find in your people.” He said that he has seen these talents in roughly the same proportions
from his graduate students from Japan and elsewhere in the world.<br><br>

Field and Subfield(s): Nanotechnology and materials science; Physics, applied (1)<br><br>
Location: Russia<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: High<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent took the view that there has been little groundbreaking change in the field
of applied physics in the past five years, despite overall progress. No specific country, institution,
or individual was identified as being a global leader. In this connection, the respondent
declined to name his pick of top institutions and researchers in Japan, for ethical reasons.
Where Japan’s strength is concerned, the respondent said, Japan has a wealth of human
capital, comparable to other countries. Japanese researchers were described as thorough in their
approach to scientific problems and precise in their experimental work, and the Japanese were
said to be an “industrious and assiduous people.” As for infrastructure, it is a good sign to see
laboratories existing in Japan.<br><br>

Another field in which Japan could hold a leading position is nanomaterials. The respondent
said that Japan’s scientists and engineers have great potential to leap forward in computer
science, where they currently lag behind.<br><br>
In his view, Japan’s technology ability is “surely higher than in the most of economically
advanced nations,” but “technological ideas are wandering in the air. It is easier to catch and
improve them than to propose a new scientific idea.”<br><br>
Finally, he said, he expects Japan to produce “a great breakthrough after the next five
years.”<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?
Except in a few scientific fields, Japanese representation in the science citation index was
observed as lower than the world average, but, our respondent said, the situation is gradually
improving.<br><br>
On research management, the respondent underscored the importance of individual creativity.
He said, “if we wish to have non-ordinary scientists we must allow them free thinking.
It means that we ought to encourage young as well as older scientists to develop their own
ideas, not only those belonging to the chief.” In his opinion, Japan’s scientific establishment
suffers from “superfluous centralization.”<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
First, he stressed that providing sufficient funding for scientific research is critical, whether it
is for research within Japan or international collaborations. In his view, with modern communication
technology at our disposal, joint research activities need not require participants
to come together to work in the same space. Rather, with proper task assignment, researchers
can use information and communication technologies to support their work and collaboration.
For instance, the raw experiment could be performed in one laboratory, while data processing
could take place in another lab that is better prepared for the task. Of course, such an approach
requires well-managed and flexible systems of joint grants (for example, research supported by
the U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation). The respondent said that he has
seen successful partnerships and urges Japan to become involved in them. Japan should take
advantage of such mechanisms to expand overseas training opportunities for its students and
researchers. When visiting a British laboratory, for example, he said, “one can see that at least
one-third of the staff are Chinese undergraduate students, Ph.D. students, or post-docs but
almost never [any] Japanese collaborators.”<br><br>
There should also be an open competition of ideas in every university department and
scientific institution in Japan. This would encourage the best ideas to come forward regardless
of the age, seniority, or reputation of the scientists behind them.<br><br>
Regarding near-term versus long-term goals, basic research should be Japan’s near-term
priority because the basic sciences lay the foundation for long-term goals. As for determining
the long-term goals, Japan should look to its unique environment to find the answers. As a
country with a poor endowment of energy and natural resources, Japan’s main efforts must be
aimed at creating energy-saving and environment-friendly technologies (including supercritical
fluid technologies) and developing alternative energy sources and storage possibilities. Another
area of focus might be in the health area. Despite good medical services in Japan, the respondent
said that “the state of healthcare sciences [in Japan] cannot be recognized as advanced”
and stressed that advances in the basic sciences are needed to turn this situation around.<br><br>

As for improving Japan’s education system, Japan, too, must go back to the “roots of the
problem.” It is a common mistake, in his view, to simply pump a great deal of knowledge into
students, most of which may turn out to be useless. The main aim of education should instead
be to develop creative thinking. This is not easy because teachers and professors have to possess
the same rare quality of creative thinking. One way to nurture talented scientists is through
competition at all education levels that aims to demonstrate the ability to think rather than
mere “knowledge about everything.” Japan, he counseled, should also attempt to understand
why Japanese engineers are internationally renowned yet the same cannot be said of its scientists.
To take this further, perhaps scientists and engineers would benefit from specialized education
programs that they can freely enter and leave.<br><br>

Field and Subfield(s): Nanotechnology and materials science; Physics, applied (2)<br><br>
Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>

Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>
Professional experience in or with Japan: Low<br><br>
What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent said that applied physics is somewhat new as a field and that he considers Japan
to be competitive in computer programming but not good at the level of theoretical, groundbreaking
research. Japan, in his view, invests a great deal of funds and energy in the area,
including having good infrastructure and administrative support, but only copies the work of
others and develops the computational or implementation aspect. The University of Tokyo and
Osaka University were named as the top institutions in Japan. Overall, he said, Japan is good
with hardware and software, but not doing as well in theoretical developments. Thus, at this
time, he would be open to collaborating with Japanese researchers but expect their contribution
to be only in computational developments.<br><br>
As such, he would expect Japan’s undergraduate and graduate systems to prepare students
well in computing but not in advancing theoretical research. He described Japanese
researchers as systematic and hardworking but said that, as they are lacking a strong theoretical
background in training, they cannot effectively engage in research to advance the field. In
his view, as long as such a bias persists in Japan, he does not expect the quality of Japan’s work
to dramatically improve. Instead, he said, he is more hopeful of the situation in China and
India, where he has seen greater support for theoretical research. Other countries doing well in
theoretical development are the United States, Germany, and France.<br><br>
Although the United States has been leading the field, he said, Europe is catching up
because of Europeans’ creativity and flexibility in putting together research teams and doing
interdisciplinary work. He said that he has seen more Japanese researchers collaborating with
peers in Europe than in the United States. Teamwork, he underscored, is especially important

in this field because “the input is physics and the output is chemistry.” The high-performing
countries are Germany, Italy, the UK, Switzerland, and France―though, in the case of France,
its academic community appears reluctant to explore this field. However, he said, Europe’s rise
is not certain, given the enormous bureaucratic burden that prevails in European countries.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
He said that Japanese researchers seem arrogant and poorly grounded in theory. Further, Japan
has money and people but lacks the approach and leaders to change the way S&T are driven
in this field.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
Japan must strengthen its theoretical foundations in the field and achieve this by setting both
short- and long-term priorities. To develop a good system, he suggested two approaches. The
first is to attract top people to establish Japan as their residence. The second is to organize conferences
to introduce new and high-quality research to Japan. In the case of the United States,
he said, after World War II, the country recruited top scientists from all over the world to settle
and work in the United States. At that time, “few people engaged themselves in theoretical
endeavors.” Eventually, the United States became a leader in the field, and a U.S. journal, Physical
Review Letters, is the top journal in the field. In his view, Japan today is where the United
States was after World War II, and it can use incentives to attract top researchers from the rest
of the world. The alternative approach of organizing seminars and collaborations is, in his view,
not sustainable. He said that no country has achieved excellence in this fashion. He said that
seminars and visiting professors do not leave enduring capabilities after the seminars end or
visitors leave. Still, either of these policies will take a number of years to have some impact on
scientific production.<br><br>
He also emphasized that Japan should also send more researchers abroad. He said that
many Japanese study abroad but that the number is not enough to sustain high-quality research
in this area. In his view, sending more Japanese researchers abroad is critical to Japan’s future
in S&T as a whole. Since it is very difficult for Americans and Europeans to adapt to Japanese
society, sending Japanese researchers abroad to upgrade their skills is the solution.<br><br>

Summary 55<br><br>
Field and Subfield(s): Nanotechnology and materials science; Physics, applied (3)<br><br>
Location: EU<br><br>
Status: Established<br><br>
Gender: Male<br><br>
Nationality: Non-Japanese<br><br>

What is the overall competitiveness of Japan in your area(s) of research, in general, and
what are Japan’s strengths in research?<br><br>
The respondent described Japan as good in reproducing and adapting products of the leading
countries and as having good industry research programs (e.g., that of Sony). However,
he did not regard Japan as innovative. For this reason, in his view, Japan will likely stay in its
current position among the top countries and will not come close to the United States or Germany,
the leaders in the field. He emphasized that U.S. success is built on individual initiative
and the freedom to think. He believes that Japan has the human and financial resources to
be innovative but that the right approach is missing. Also, he said, he believes that Japan lags
behind because it copies what the leaders like the United States have done instead of focusing
its energy on new endeavors.<br><br>
Nevertheless, he reported seeing dramatic improvement in one area for Japan: communication.
He said that there has been improvement not only in terms of English language skills
but also in the way messages are delivered. Ten years ago, Japanese scientists went to conferences
and did not speak well or answer questions correctly because they did not understand
what was asked. Such poor performance seems to be a thing of the past.<br><br>
In his view, the top Japanese institutions in his field are the University of Tokyo, Tsukuba
University, and Osaka University. However, their strength, he underscored, is in implementation
and not in the study of theory and fundamentals.<br><br>
Japan’s S&T capabilities were judged to be adequate and benefit from having good facilities
and funding. He said that Japanese researchers also benefit from having a high level
of administrative support. By comparison, researchers in Europe, he said, have to personally
handle a great deal more paperwork in grant applications and “have to be their own travel
agency, secretary, and copier [clerk].”<br><br>
He rated Japanese education as generally high in quality but thought that it, too, lacked
strength in theoretical formation and had an overemphasis on implementation. Still, in his
opinion, Japan is not in a worse situation than Europe (e.g., Germany builds its strength in the
field on the work of two to three very good institutions and groups of researchers). He noted
Norway as another small country that has done well in applied physics in recent years, producing
a disproportionately high number of publications. He attributed this success to political
support for science (e.g., he said that the mayor of Oslo once met with all the participants of a
professional congress) and funds that target activities that foster innovation. He said that the
UK values independence and creativity in research but has serious funding problems across
the field. Each university’s situation varies widely, depending on its contributors and boards.<br><br>
He said that Britain especially suffered and lost its competitive position under Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher’s government and that, while recovery efforts are under way, progress is
slow. France was said to be not particularly good in this subfield and to suffer the same bureaucratic
problems that plague academia in Europe. Germany, by comparison, has managed to
do well in his field because it shares the Anglo-Saxon mindset of valuing independence and
freedom in research. Nevertheless, the U.S. system is better. He strongly emphasized that the
U.S. education and academic environment are the best in the world.<br><br>
What do you think are the weaknesses or hindrances to greater excellence for Japan?<br><br>
Japan’s central problem in achieving scientific excellence is not the lack of funding or human
capital but its general approach to scientific and technological development. Too much emphasis
was said to be placed on practical aspects and not enough on the theoretical side. Describing this situation, the respondent made an analogy to the Roman and Greek civilizations:<br><br>
The Roman Empire left a legacy of production techniques, while Greek civilization gave us
philosophy. He said that China is doing the same thing as Japan. He added that, to make it
worse, Chinese researchers do a poor job copying (at least Japanese researchers have some fundamental
understanding of theory in the field) and plagiarize extensively in their publications.<br><br>
He cautioned against a high level of centralization. Central policy guidelines, he said,
could be wrong (e.g., focusing funding on implementation or topics that are no longer relevant)
and, thus, hinder Japan’s potential to produce breakthrough research. The respondent did not
see ties between academia and industry as inherently a problem but said that industry funding
of academic research could reinforce the bias toward “practical” research.<br><br>
So, while increased international collaboration is a good thing, it is not going to improve
Japanese S&T as long as Japan does not change the way it approaches science.<br><br>
What are your recommendations for Japan?<br><br>
First of all, Japan’s S&T policy has to take a balanced approach. Every country, in his view,
needs to maintain a diverse portfolio of research projects across fields. Thus far, he said, Japan
tends to follow and build on others’ pioneering work. This is not a good strategy, not only
because of the resulting lag in production but also because it tends to concentrate resources in
a particular area. In his field, he believes that tradition is important but that the field is also
well diversified, allowing enough topics and areas for universities and research centers to find
their own niche and produce innovative research.<br><br>
Universities in Japan should learn from the American system, he said. Specifically, there
should be significant rewards for innovation and creativity, and individuals should be incentivized
to pursue personal projects independently and freely without the interference of superiors
or group structures or central policy directives. He stressed that it is individual initiative, rather
than groups, that creates innovation.<br><br>
S&T should be based on groundbreaking innovation and communicated via publication
in the top journals in the appropriate subfields. Currently, academic achievement is valued only
in terms of the number of publications or citations, without consideration to the journals in
which they are published. This, he said, misleads and misguides scientific activities. Further,
innovation is threatened as long as mere production is rewarded, no matter how repetitive
or lacking in novelty (e.g., reproducing one experiment in slightly different conditions). He
stressed that discoveries occur and Nobel prizes are awarded based on significant publications
but not necessarily on having a large number of them.<br><br>
Finally, Japan should invest more in collaboration programs―current ones being just five
to ten years old―and encourage more collaboration.<br><br>

明石康、原联合国副秘书长<br><br>
日本的影响力变得微弱<br><br>

　　作为一个日本人和关注国际关系的人，我对日本政治的低迷状况感到遗憾。短命政府一个接一个地换，日本没有展示本应该有的国际性愿景，日本经济也萎靡不振。<br><br>
 　　政治领导人频繁更换的负面影响也被外国指出，以前被说"敲打日本"(Japan Bashing)，日本在国际上拥有实力时受到了批评。其中既有合理的批评，也有无理的诽谤，但是受到批评说明也受到关注。<br><br>
 　　然而，现在是"无视日本"（Japan Passing），也就是对日本视而不见的状况。<br><br>
 　　这是日本在世界上的影响力减弱的表现。让亚洲的人们、世界各国理解日本正在考虑的事、担心的事、期待的事，这对于日本和日本国民来说非常重要。<br><br>
 　　日本在国际社会的影响力变得微弱，对此我强烈感到一种难以言表的焦虑。海外的朋友也对我表示担忧称"日本没有办法了吗？"<br><br>

近年的政府在外交上失败<br><br>

　　首相短期内更换的情况从自民党政权末期开始持续下来。时间短到无法描绘明确的愿景并落实这些政策。<br><br>
 　　民主党执政时，虽然在国内问题上野田内阁想方设法实现了消费税增税，但外交方面依然停滞不前。<br><br>
 　　鸠山前首相在冲绳的美军基地问题上招致了使迄今为止在日美关系上的努力化为泡影的结果。<br><br>
 　　菅政府应对3 11（东日本大地震）时在没有跟邻近国家取得任何联系的情况下向太平洋排放了福岛核电站事故引起的辐射污染水。想想地震发生后，包括邻近各国在内的众多国家提供了温暖人心的国际性援助和支持，真的很遗憾。<br><br>
 　　尽管发生悲惨的灾害，但灾区人们舍身忘我地相互帮助，还有日本国民奋发努力的姿态也向世界展现了日本拥有的软实力，世界也投来钦佩的目光，因此对上述状况感到万分可惜。<br><br>

日中两国政府需尽力为事态降温<br><br>

　　接着到野田执政时期，政府起初表态将积极参与TPP（跨太平洋经济伙伴关系协定），但此事后来处于搁置状态。而且尖阁诸岛、竹岛问题也浮出水面，日中、日韩关系也随之恶化。<br><br>
 　　正因为当下需要亚洲各国团结一致，才更应该直面并致力于解决这些问题。至少需要冷静应对，避免事态朝着坏的方向发展。<br><br>
 　　围绕尖阁问题，我觉得中国也决不是想要战争。去年夏天，"第八届东京-北京论坛"在东京举办，我作为执行委员长发表了主旨演讲，其中这样讲道：<br><br>
 　　"为了防止眼前的对立和冲突朝着日中两国不希望看到的方向发展，需要尽快建立危机管理和为事态降温的牢固机制。回顾近代的国际政治，有好多不幸的例子表明不足取的偶发性冲突在事态令人惊恐的情况下朝着相关国家领导人谁都不希望的方向升级，最终导致局面无法收拾。可以说，日中两国政府负有共同的义务，应该想尽办法使这些小冲突和争端不要演变成进退两难的严重事态，努力防范于未然。<br><br>
 　　必须考虑为事态降温、冷却的手段，防止朝着谁也不希望的坏方向急剧升级。建立各种方式的渠道，坦率地进行对话就能形成共同的问题意识。在当今复杂的国际形势中这是不可缺少的。<br><br>
 　　但尽管如此，很遗憾日中两国均出现让人想起20世纪30年代民族主义想法的倾向，总觉得双方似乎迷失了举起拳头后放下的契机。双方需要相互认清日中两国的共同利益在哪里，采取明智的应对措施避免大的冲突。<br><br>

日本应该为国际社会做的事<br><br>

　　日本经济的长期低迷应该也是日本在世界上的影响力趋弱的原因之一。<br><br>
 　　在亚洲，中国、韩国、印度等国实现经济增长，国力得到增强。第二次世界大战后，日本在亚洲率先实现了令世界惊叹的高速经济增长，但是最近二十年日本表现低迷使得国民情绪低落。<br><br>
 　　20世纪90年代日本在世界各国的政府开发援助（ODA）中独占鳌头。现在却减到了以往的一半一下，排名也从首位跌至第五位。不说总量，就连人均金额与北欧各国等相比也令人惭愧。联合国大会通过决议要求发达国家提供国民生产总值的约0.7%作为ODA，而日本仅提供了0.2%。<br><br>
 　　日本若要发挥软实力，ODA方面的配合不可或缺，然而减少到这个程度实在令人遗憾。<br><br>

与美国的同盟关系带来的东西<br><br>
在战后60年多年中，美国为日本的复兴提供了援助，也为日本的民主化尽力。冷战后的国际形势下，日本能够以轻军备完事可以说正是因为存在与美国的同盟关系。<br><br>
 　　虽然与美国之间也存在基地问题等难题，但重视与美国的同盟关系对于避免日本过度持有军备并走向核武装来说是不可或缺的因素。<br><br>
 　　因此，应认识到为了维持与美国的同盟关系，日本也应该负担相应的成本。<br><br>
 　　重视与美国的同盟关系不会导致日本军事大国化。此次获得连任的奥巴马政府明确显示出与中国保持良好关系的可能性。可以说奥巴马政府的目标是构建包括中国在内的新国际秩序。<br><br>

过度的悲观不会产生任何东西<br><br>

　　虽然日本处于严峻的状况，但决不应该悲观，而应该朝着好的方向努力。我想其方向性有以下两点。<br><br>
 　　第一是少子老龄化问题。这不是仅日本面临的问题，韩国、台湾、新加坡、东欧和南欧等地也都一样。作为对策，我想绝对需要让年轻人在经济上对未来拥有更加光明的前景。<br><br>
 　　同时为了发挥女性的活力，应该在所有方面消除对女性的歧视，对于育儿实施各种优厚的保护政策。<br><br>
 　　此外，我认为应热情迎接有技能的外国人，使其融入日本社会。我想通过这一系列政策，既然日本人口减少但下滑速度缓慢，日本的活力和国际竞争力就应该能得以维持。<br><br>
 　　第二点是培养全球性人才的观点。政府、学界和经济团体等均对此表示赞同。虽然日本也有为时太晚的一面，但目前经济金融、科学技术、环境等所有领域国境均已失去意义。信息也在世界实时传播。<br><br>
 　　仅在国内就可以了事的时代已一去不复返。应该在国内培养能翱翔于世界的人才，也从外国接纳众多留学生，同时让众多年轻人走向世界。为留学生创造条件让他们在留学之后对就业岗位无后顾之忧也很重要。经济界也显示出了支持的态度。<br><br>
 　　如果能在少子老龄化和培养全球性人才方面出台有效的政策，我想这个国家的未来是光明的。<br><br>
 　　现在，国内政治和国际政治已经没有界限。日本面临的问题仅在国内是无法解决的。现在日本才更应该构筑一贯的综合性政治哲学，与世界各国携手前行，难道不是吗？<br><br>

在钓鱼岛问题上，日本显得苍白无力。日本政府固执地认为我国的钓鱼岛（尖阁诸岛）无论是从历史上还是从国际法上都是日本固有的领土。以下为日本方面的辩护词。哪怕罪大恶极之人，也应给与其自我辩护的权利。当然，既然为自己说话，难免有几分矫情。读者自辨。编者未审先判，日本败诉。证据？莫须有！不服？你敢碰我一下先？！！<br><br>

第二次世界大战之后，1951年的《旧金山和平条约》从法律上确认了日本领土，尖阁诸岛不被包含在根据该条约我国所放弃的“台湾及澎湖诸岛”之内，而作为南西诸岛一部分被置于美国施政之下。 <br><br>
中华民国（台湾）在《日华和平条约》（1952年签署）上追认了《旧金山和平条约》，并对上述尖阁诸岛的处理没有提出过任何异议。中国也没有提出过任何异议。 <br><br>
尖阁诸岛被包含在于1972年根据《冲绳归还协定》将施政权归还给日本的地区之内。<br><br> 


中国在于1968年尖阁诸岛周边海域下面蕴藏石油之可能性被指出之后才开始有关尖阁诸岛领有权的主张。此前，中国对日本拥有该诸岛没有提出过任何异议。 <br><br>
中国的刊物中也有记载来证明中国将尖阁诸岛认识为日本领土。<br><br> 
 （例：1960年在中国发行的《中国世界地图集》（附件）中，尖阁诸岛被记载为属于冲绳的岛屿。）<br><br> 
在1972年日中邦交正常化之际，周恩来总理称，“因为发现了石油，这就成了问题。” <br><br>


尖阁诸岛在历史上也一贯是日本领土南西诸岛的组成部分。 <br><br>
自1885年以来，日本政府在通过冲绳县政府等途径再三对尖阁诸岛进行实地调查，慎重确认尖阁诸岛不仅为无人岛，而且没有受到清朝统治的痕迹之后，才正式编入我国领土之内。 <br><br>
尖阁诸岛没有被包含在按照1895年4月的《下关条约（马关条约）》由清朝割让给日本的“台湾及澎湖诸岛”当中。 <br><br>
中方所提出的文献及地图的记载内容均不足以构成证明中国拥有领有权的论据。<br><br>


尖阁诸岛是日本固有领土，这无论是在历史上还是在国际法上都很明确，实际上我国有效控制着该诸岛。因此，根本不存在围绕尖阁诸岛要解决的领有权问题。<br><br>


 　　第二次世界大战之后，在一九五二年四月生效的《旧金山和平条约》从法律角度上确认了战后的日本领土，尖阁诸岛不被包含在其第二条规定的我国所放弃的领土之内，而基于其第三条规定，作为南西诸岛一部分被置于美国施政之下。后来又根据一九七二年五月生效的《日本国与美利坚合众国关于琉球诸岛及大东诸岛的协定》（《冲绳返还协定》），尖阁诸岛被包含在把施政权归还给日本的地区之内。上述事实极其明确地显示出尖阁诸岛作为我国领土的地位。<br><br>


 　　尖阁诸岛在历史上始终都是日本领土的南西诸岛的一部分。原来，自一八八五年以来，日本政府通过冲绳县政府等途径多次对尖阁诸岛进行实地调查，慎重确认尖阁诸岛不仅为无人岛，而且也没有受到清朝统治的痕迹。在此基础上，于一八九五年一月十四日，由内阁会议（“阁议”）决定在岛上建立标桩，以正式编入我国领土之内。<br><br>


　　此外，尖阁诸岛没有被包含在按照一八九五年五月生效的《下关条约（马关条约）》第二条规定由清朝割让给日本的台湾及澎湖诸岛当中。再者，尖阁诸岛根据《旧金山和平条约》第三条被置于美国施政之下，中国对这一事实从未提出过任何异议，由此可以明确地看出，中国没有将尖阁诸岛视为台湾的一部分。中华民国（台湾）随后通过一九五二年八月生效的《日华和平条约》承认了《旧金山和平条约》。<br><br>


 　　中国政府以及台湾当局在一九七十年代以后才开始有关尖阁诸岛的独自主张，也就是于一九六八年秋联合国有关组织的调查结果公布，即发现东海下面有可能蕴藏石油，并由此尖阁诸岛开始受到人们的关注之后。<br><br>




　　迄今中国政府及台湾当局作为所谓历史上、地理上、地质上的依据等提出的各类观点，均不足以构成国际法上的有效论据来证明中国对尖阁诸岛拥有领有权的主张。<br><br>

日本有关东海资源开发的法律立场 <br><br>


 

 

一、根据《联合国海洋法公约》的相关规定，日中双方拥有距领海基线200海里以内的专属经济区及大陆架的权利依据。由于位于东海两侧的日中两国的领海基线之间相距不到400海里，因此双方的200海里专属经济区及大陆架存在相互重叠部分，就此需要日中之间通过协商划定界限。根据《联合国海洋法公约》的相关规定和国际判例，在这种水域划定界限时以中间线为准划定界限就可以得到公平解决。<br><br>

（注：1海里=1.852 km, 200海里=370.4 km）<br><br>

  

二、 <br><br>
1、中方主张在东海划定界限应该依据大陆架的自然延伸、大陆与岛屿的对比等东海之特点来进行，不承认按照中间线来划定界限，同时中方并未提出设定的具体界限线，而且主张大陆架自然延伸到冲绳海槽。 <br><br>

 

2、自然延伸论是在上个世纪60年代有关相邻国家间大陆架界限的划定判例上被采用等在过去的国际法上被采用的观点。根据1982年通过的《联合国海洋法公约》的相关规定以及之后的国际判例，倘若两岸国家之间距离不到400海里，则该水域的划界不容承认自然延伸论，而且像冲绳海槽那样的海底地形并无法律上的意义。因此，按照现今的国际法，以为可以主张将大陆架延伸到冲绳海槽的观点是缺乏根据的。<br><br> 

 

三、以上述为前提，我国的一贯立场是，针对尚未划定界线的水域，理所当然我国至少应在中间线以东的日方水域可以行使主权权力和管辖权。但是，这毫不意味着我国放弃了对中间线以西的水域拥有的权利依据，而不过是我国在划定界限之前暂时对中间线以东的水域行使主权权力和管辖权而已。因此，在日中之间尚未完成东海划界并且中方一概不承认我国有关中间线主张的情况下，我国对距本国领海基线200海里以内的专属经济区及大陆架拥有权利依据之事实丝毫没有改变。 <br><br>

Q1. 对于上次的大战，日本政府持有怎样的历史认识？<br><br>

 

1. 我国曾经通过殖民统治和侵略，给许多国家、特别是亚洲国家人民造成了巨大损害和痛苦。我国谦虚地对待这一历史事实，时刻铭记深刻的反省和由衷的歉意。第二次世界大战以后，我国一贯坚持只做经济大国，不做军事大国，以和平方式解决一切问题的立场。<br><br> 

  

2. 如上所述，我国正视关于上次大战的过去，站在深刻反省的立场上，将与包括中国、韩国在内的亚洲各国建立面向未来的合作关系。我国认为今后日本将继续为世界的和平与繁荣做出贡献。 <br><br>


  
（参考1）小泉纯一郎内阁总理大臣谈话（2005年8月15日）（部分） <br><br>

  

    我国由于殖民统治和侵略给许多国家、特别是给亚洲各国人民带来了巨大的损害和痛苦。我谦虚地对待这一历史事实，谨此再次表示深刻的反省和由衷的歉意。同时谨向在上次大战中遇难的所有国内外人士表示沉痛的哀悼。我们决心不淡忘这一悲惨的战争的教训，决不会再次使兵戎相见，为世界的和平与繁荣做出贡献。 <br><br>

  

    我国战后的历史正是以实际行动体现对战争反省的60年。 <br><br>

  

    我国与亚洲各国之间在经济、文化等广泛领域的交流已经发展到了空前的程度。我认为，尤其是与一衣带水的中国、韩国等亚洲各国之间，我国有必要携起手来，共同维持这一地区的和平并谋求发展。我国正视过去，正确认识历史，愿意基于相互理解和信赖关系与亚洲各国建立起面向未来的合作关系。 <br><br>

 

 

Q2. 日本对在战争中受到伤害的亚洲各国没有进行正式道歉？<br><br>

 

1. 我国时刻铭记曾经由于日本的殖民统治和侵略，给许多国家、特别是亚洲国家人民造成了巨大损害和痛苦，我们时刻铭记深刻的反省和由衷的歉意。我国在1995年8月15日内阁总理大臣讲话中等，到现在为止利用很多机会明确表达了反省与道歉的心情，及决不重复这一段不幸的历史的决心。 <br><br>

 

2. 例如，小泉总理大臣在2005年8月15日的谈话中，表达了这种反省与道歉的心情 。另外，到目前为止，日本利用中国、韩国等各国首脑访日的机会等，也表达了这种反省与道歉的心情。 <br><br>

 

 

Q3. 日本对于在上次的战争中受到伤害的国家和人民进行了怎样的赔偿？<br><br>

 

1. 战后，我国与相关各国间，一并处理了赔偿、财产及请求权的问题。这种方式被当时的国际社会普遍接受。<br><br> 

 

2. 具体来说，我国与相关各国缔结了旧金山和平条约及两国的和平条约等，并根据这些条约切实进行了赔偿、支付等。对与上次战争的索求权等问题，与签订条约的当事国通过法律已经解决。 <br><br>

 

 

（参考2）按照旧金山和平条约的规定进行战后赔偿的例子 <br><br>
i. 向菲律宾和越南分别支付了5亿5000 万美元（1980亿日元）和3900万美元（140亿4000万日元）的赔偿。<br><br> 
ii. 作为对战俘的赔偿，日本向国际红十字会支付了450万英镑（约45亿4109万日元）。 <br><br>
iii. 日本放弃海外财产（约236亿8100万美元：约相当于3794亿9900万日元） <br><br>

 

（参考3）个别和平条约规定的进行战后处理的例子 <br><br>
i. 向缅甸和印度尼西亚分别支付2亿美元（720亿日元）和2亿2308万美元（803亿880万日元）。 <br><br>
ii. 苏联：日苏共同宣言（1956年） <br><br>
iii.苏联放弃向日本提出的所有赔偿要求，日苏双方相互放弃由于战争的结果而提出的所有要求。<br><br> 


 

Q4. 既然政府间的赔偿已经得到了解决，是不是受害者个人的索求权要另当别论？<br><br>

 

1. 战争结束后，我国与各相关国家一并处理了赔偿及财产、索求权的问题。那时，也一并处理了个人索求权的问题。例如，旧金山和平条约中规定，联合国的国民及日本国国民对对方国家及其国民的请求权都已被放弃。 <br><br>

 

2. 关于个人的索求权问题，在旧金山和平条约和两国间的和平条约与当事国之间，在法律上都得到了解决。 <br><br>

 

 

Q5. 日本政府如何看待“从军慰安妇问题”？<br><br>

 

1. 日本政府认识到所谓的从军慰安妇问题伤害了许多女性的名誉和尊严。并且，政府一直向那些经历了很多痛苦，身心都受到了难以治愈的伤害的所有从军慰安妇们，表示衷心的道歉和反省。 <br><br>

 

2. 包括这个问题在内与上次大战相关的赔偿、财产、索求权等问题都从法律上得到了解决，但是政府为了救助那些已成为高龄者的原慰安妇们的现实生活问题，一直尽最大努力协助向原慰安妇们支付“补偿金”、实施医疗、福利援助的亚洲女性基金。<br><br>

 


 

Q6. 日本总理大臣参拜靖国神社是为了将过去的殖民统治和侵略正当化？<br><br>

 

1. 就自己参拜靖国神社一事，小泉总理表示，“我参拜的目的是为了向明治维新以来，我国历史上那些迫不得已而告别家人，为国捐躯的所有人表示衷心的哀悼。日本今天的和平与繁荣是建立在众多战死者的值得敬重的牺牲之上。今后，坚守和平，坚持遵守再也不发动悲惨战争的誓言是非常重要的。”这显然不是为了将过去的殖民统治和侵略正当化。 <br><br>

 

2. 另外，小泉总理还在2005年8月15日的谈话中和2005年4月22日的亚非首脑会议上表示，我国曾经通过殖民统治和侵略，给许多国家、特别是亚洲国家人民造成了巨大损害和痛苦。我国谦虚地对待这一历史事实，时刻铭记深刻反省和由衷的歉意。第二次世界大战以后，我国一贯坚持只做经济大国，不做军事大国，和平解决一切问题的立场，再次向国际社会清楚地表明了我国对与二战相关的历史的认识。<br><br> 

  
   

（参考4）日本政府关于小泉总理参拜靖国神社的基本立场（05.10.25） <br><br>

 

 

Q7. 日本的历史教科书受到了其他国家的批评，它是怎样制定的？<br><br>

 

1. 在日本，民间出版社将作为教科书的著作、编纂的图书提交给文部科学省。在文部科学省经过由专家组成的审议会的审议，审定其作为教科书是否合适。 <br><br>

 

2. 教科书必须按照学校教育大纲的基准，即学习指导要领进行编纂。在此基础上，民间出版社将具体的内容、叙述的方法等委托给执笔者。 <br><br>

 

3. 特别是在历史教科书的审定上，国家并不是站在一个确定的历史认识和历史事实的立场上进行审定的。而是参照审定时的一些客观的学术成果和准确的资料，指出叙述欠缺的地方。 <br><br>

 

4.也就是说，在审定中，如果申请的图书中出现明显的错误和有失公正的叙述，文部科学省会在此附上意见。但这些意见不是对记述内容作具体的指示，也无法对执笔者的基本历史认识进行修改，更不能要求提起某些特定的历史事件等。 <br><br>

 

5. 因此，不能说每种历史教科书的历史认识和历史观都与政府的看法一致。 <br><br>

 


 

Q8. 日本政府怎样看待“南京大屠杀“？<br><br>

 

1. 日本政府认为，无法否认日军在进入南京（1937年）以后，杀害了很多非战斗人员和掠夺行为等的事实。 <br><br>

 

2. 但是，关于受害者的具体人数却有很多说法，日本政府认为很难认定哪些数据是准确的。 <br><br>

 

3. 日本坦率认识到：在过去的一段时期，由于殖民统治和侵略，给很多国家，尤其是亚洲各国的人民带来了巨大的损害和痛苦。我们会把深刻的反省和衷心的道歉时刻铭记于心，决心不再发动战争，走和平的道路。 <br><br>

 

 

 

Q9. 日本政府怎样看待远东国际军事审判？<br><br>

 

1. 远东国际军事审判（东京审判）是战后联合国为了对日本的重要战犯进行判决而设置的法庭。有28人因危害和平罪和违反人道主义罪等罪名被起诉。除病死和免予起诉以外的人以外，其余25人都被判有罪。 <br><br>

 

2. 日本知道关于这次审判有各种议论。但我国认为，我国在国与国的关系中，按照旧金山和平条约第11条的规定，接受了远东国际军事法庭的判决，因此我国不再就此次审判发表异议的立场。 <br><br>

 

 

Q10. 与德国相比，日本解决过去问题的工作不够？<br><br>

 

1. 日德两国都诚实地对待“过去的问题”。 <br><br>

 

2. 另一方面，德国与日本在二战中发生了什么，以及在什么样的状况下进行战后处理等这些历史经过完全不同。例如，日本依据当时国际社会能够接受的一般方式，按照旧金山和平条约等，与当事国之间一并处理了赔偿等问题。我国了解到德国在战后被分为东、西两部分，因此没能像我国一样一并处理国家间的赔偿等问题，采取了个人补偿的方式。 <br><br>

 

3. 像上面所述，日本与德国分别以不同的方式进行战后处理，因此，不能简单地比较和评价两国的态度。 <br><br>


小泉总理参拜靖国神社的基本立场<br><br>

 

2005年10月25日<br><br>
 

 

 

    小泉总理坚定地认为今天日本的和平与稳定，来自于阵亡者尊贵的牺牲。总理对那些为了祖国而违背心愿地奔赴战场并献出了生命的人们怀有衷心的哀悼、尊敬及感谢的心情，同时深切体会守护那些阵亡者们所无法看到的今天日本的和平与繁荣的重要性，带着不战之诺，仅以一个国民的立场，而非以总理大臣的职务去参拜靖国神社。 <br><br>

 

    认为小泉总理参拜靖国神社是试图美化过去的军国主义的观点是错误的。总理曾经明确表示，参拜靖国神社是为了表示对阵亡者的敬意和谢意，并不是为了参拜甲级战犯。他同时明确表示，日本接受了远东国际军事法庭审判的结果。小泉总理承认，“我国由于殖民统治和侵略给许多国家，特别是给亚洲各国的人民带来了巨大损失和痛苦”。他同时多次表示，应该“谦虚地对待这一历史事实，时刻铭记深刻的反省和由衷的歉意”，日本“珍视同世界各国的信任关系，决心为世界的和平与繁荣做出贡献”等。小泉总理在今年4月份的亚非会议的演说中，向世界表明了这一观点，而且在战后60周年的8月份，以总理谈话的形式对该观点进行了阐述。 <br><br>

 

    现在的东亚逐步得到了成为世界上少有的发达地区的机会。将来形成东亚共同体也成为共同的课题。在这一历史转折点上，日本决心为东亚的未来做出建设性的贡献。为此 ，日本十分重视与包括中国、韩国在内的亚洲邻国之间的友好合作关系。日本已经在战后的60年中以行动表明了这一立场。今后将进一步加强与各邻国的关系，为东亚地区的和平与稳定做出贡献，是日本最重要的政策之一。<br><br>
