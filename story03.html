	<b><a name="T1">CHAPTER TWO Summary of Expert Responses</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
	This chapter summarizes the information we received from the 55 leading scientists we interviewed.<br><br>
There are six sections in this chapter:<br><br>
 The first reports sources of information or ways in which our respondents said they obtain
information about quality of research and S&T education in Japan.<br><br>
 The second summarizes comments from respondents on the competitiveness of Japanese
research, organized by the four categories (life sciences, environmental science, ICT, and
nanotechnology and materials science) and the 25 fields under them.<br><br>
 The third presents our respondents’ opinions on quality of training, human capital, infrastructure,
organization and research management, and national policy for S&T in Japan.<br><br>
 The fourth highlights strengths that our respondents said could aid efforts to build greater
excellence in Japanese research.<br><br>
 The fifth highlights weaknesses that our respondents said could hinder efforts to build
greater excellence in Japanese research.<br><br>
 The sixth reports our respondents’ recommendations that the Japanese government might
consider to improve Japan’s S&T performance in particular research fields and areas, as
well as Japan’s standing in global science.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T2">Sources of Information</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Our respondents reported several major sources of information on which they based their
opinion on the quality of Japanese research and education.<br><br>
The most frequently cited was the major scientific journals in their fields and subfields of
research. In their view, publication in the top-tier journals of their fields and subfields is a clear
reflection of the quality of research and engagement with the international scientific community.<br><br>
Also, we were told that the top-tier journals are typically in English. Thus, publication
in these journals, in their view, is one indication of English proficiency among researchers in
a particular country and their ability to engage with the international scientific community.<br><br>
Professional conferences worldwide and professional visits to Japan also gave many of our
respondents the opportunity for firsthand interaction with their Japanese peers and to directly
observe the quality of Japanese research, facilities, and equipment. In fact, several respondents
noted Japan’s active involvement in organizing and hosting many international scientific conferences
in recent years, and they credited such expanded involvement for their visits to Japan.<br><br>

<a href= "pic50.html">日本的真心话和大冒险</a><br><br>

A third source for our respondents is their past or current collaborations with Japanese
researchers. Six reported having held research fellowships or faculty positions in Japan or
having served as advisers and reviewers on scientific boards and panels in Japan. However,
none reported active collaboration with Japanese researchers at the time of our interviews, and
a small handful explicitly stated no desire to conduct research in Japan. For those who have no
active collaboration, most reported not having found the right Japanese researchers with whom
to work. Others attributed their choice of not working with Japanese researchers or in Japan
to personal preferences in locations for employment and living, as well as (real or perceived)
barriers in language and cross-cultural communication, differences in institutional setups and
social norms, and challenges securing funding for international research collaborations and
travel expenses.<br><br>
Finally, more than a fifth of our respondents have had Japanese researchers, postdoctoral
research fellows, and students visit their laboratories or work with them. Through firsthand
experiences with these Japanese scientists and students, respondents reported that they gained
insights into the state of the art in their areas of research in Japan and how well the Japanese
system educates its scientific talent and functions to support S&T education and R&D
activities.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">Competitiveness of Japanese Research</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Our first major question in our interviews was to learn, from our respondents’ perspective or
experience, how the quality of Japanese research compares with the best in the world within
their fields, where they have seen improvements in the quality of Japanese research in recent
years, and in what other countries they might have seen significant improvement. Again, we
urge readers to be mindful of the caveats stated in the preceding chapter in their review of the
information reported here. Also, more-detailed summaries for each of the 55 interviews conducted
can be found in Appendix B.<br><br>
Overall, 22 of our 55 respondents reported that Japan is at the forefront, is among the
top five leaders, or has demonstrated significant improvement in their research areas. Another
dozen reported that Japan is doing very well, produces high-quality research, or is among
the top ten leaders in the world. This compares well with the responses received in our 2004
study. Similarly, though, respondents frequently qualified their assessments that Japan’s excellence
is in technology development, applied research, or areas in which expensive equipment is
required rather than in theoretical or fundamental research.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
Overall, our 18 respondents regarded Japan as among the world’s leaders in the many fields
and research areas in which they work. However, Japan’s achievement was frequently described
as largely technical―that is, developing or refining existing ideas―rather than conceptual―
producing innovative research that reaches beyond existing knowledge boundaries. Also, several
respondents observed China and India as growing in their research capacity, although
none of the respondents speculated on when these two countries might catch up with or surpass
Japan. Among the top institutions in Japan named were Fukuoka University, the Japan
Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), Kyoto University, Kyushu
University, RIKEN, Nagoya University, Okayama University, and the University of Tokyo.<br><br>

 <a href= "pic50.html">日本的真心话和大冒险</a><br><br>

RIKEN, in particular, stood out for the many times our respondents named it for producing
high-quality research and for providing a more open and creative research environment for
young researchers.<br><br>
Agricultural Sciences. Comments from three respondents focused on the quality of Japanese
research in biogenetics, soil chemistry, marine biology, and agricultural sciences overall.
In biogenetics, Japan was seen as lagging behind the world’s leaders. While Japan produces
good materials (e.g., ionic membranes), it was perceived to lack the ability to define the “big
questions” in research and to largely follow the leadership of other countries. In soil chemistry,
Japan was seen as a world leader, but the respondent said that there has been no major
breakthrough research from Japan in recent decades. As for agricultural sciences, Japan was
observed to have produced some good but not world-class research.<br><br>
Overall, in the life sciences, the United States was ranked as the world’s leader, and
China, India, Brazil, Spain, and several other countries were observed to be rapidly improving
and expected to become leaders if they continue to improve. Their improvement was attributed
to their effort to open up their education and research systems (e.g., sending more students and
researchers overseas and inviting foreign scientists to join their faculty and research groups)
and their emphasis on merit-based research funding and promotions. (See Appendix B, summaries
1C3.)<br><br>
Biology and Biochemistry. Opinions of our four respondents on the competitiveness of
Japanese research in this field ranged from very good to uncertain. Again, Japan was described
as not being a source of groundbreaking innovation. Japan’s strength, in their view, was in
building on existing technology and making it more accessible. They ranked the United States
as the global leader and reported significant improvements in Ireland in the past decade as a
result of a good diagnosis of its weaknesses and government policies that were appropriately
designed to invigorate research. (See Appendix B, summaries 4, 5, 6, and 7.)<br><br>
Clinical Medicine. Within this field, one respondent spoke specifically on the quality of
Japanese research in molecular parasitology. This respondent did not regard Japan as a leader
and remarked that Japan’s contribution to this research area is a small one. Leaders in this specific
area, in this respondent’s opinion, are the United States, Britain, and Australia. Ireland,
too, was reported to have made significant improvements clinical medicine research in the
past decade. This respondent attributes Ireland’s success to its policy of attracting top-quality
students and scientists domestically and from overseas to come to Ireland, including Irish scientists
based overseas. Finally, this respondent credited the Irish success to increase in research
funds, improved research environment, and a higher quality of life. (See Appendix B, summary
8.)<br><br>
Immunology. For this field, our respondent rated Japan as among the top 20th percentile
of countries globally in terms of productivity (e.g., number of published papers) and lower on
the scale (top 50 percent) in terms of the innovativeness of its work. The best work, in her view,
is done in the United States and Britain, followed by Switzerland, France, and Australia. Japan
was described as being extremely strong in research efforts that require strength in numbers.
She also rated Japanese researchers in this field as efficient but lacking in innovation and creativity.
(See Appendix B, summary 9.)<br><br>
Microbiology. Within this field, our respondent commented specifically on Japanese
research in marine biology. Japan was observed to have some world-class researchers and to
have invested heavily in equipment, but our respondent described Japanese research in this area
as lacking in innovation. This respondent added that, in his view, Japan should produce higher quality work in this area considering the level of research support available and the fact that
Japan is an island country surrounded by the sea. (See Appendix B, summary 10.)<br><br>
Molecular Biology and Genetics. Our respondent spoke on his views about Japanese
research in this field. Japan was viewed as able to produce high-quality research but as lagging
far behind the United States and Britain, which he identified as the leaders in this field.
In genomics, in particular, he noted Japan’s contribution to developing extensive expressed
sequence tag sequencing. While Japan does well in this field, this respondent observed that
China is rapidly rising as a result of increased funding for research and infrastructure and overseas
training for Chinese scientists. In addition, Chinese researchers were described as having
an aggressive and independent spirit. This, the respondent said, can aid them to produce morecreative
research. (See Appendix B, summary 11.)<br><br>
Neuroscience and Behavior. Our three respondents differed considerably in their opinions
about the quality of Japanese research in this field. Two commented on Japanese research
in neuroscience. One described Japan as “a serious player,” “really brilliant,” and at the forefront
of the field, while the other did not consider Japanese research in this area as highly
competitive by world standards. The third respondent commented on the quality of Japanese
research in psychology. The best Japanese researchers, we were told, had left Japan. In his
view, the United States is the leader in psychology research, while Hong Kong, China, India,
France, and Poland were observed to have made significant improvement in this area as a result
of increased international research exchanges with the United States. (See Appendix B, summaries
12, 13, and 14.)<br><br>
Pharmacology and Toxicology. One respondent spoke on Japan’s performance in these
areas. Japan was rated as being among the top five in the world, with the United States and
Britain being the world’s leaders in pharmacology research. He credited the Japanese government’s
investment in pharmacology research and related areas as critical to Japan’s success.
However, Japan’s scientific achievements in drug development were characterized as largely
technical and not highly innovative. By comparison, this respondent said that China and
India’s capacity in pharmacology research is increasing, and he credits this improvement to an
emphasis on merit-based funding, professional mobility, and incentives for achievements. (See
Appendix B, summary 15.)<br><br>
Plant and Animal Science. Three respondents commented on Japan’s performance and
rated Japan as a top leader in this field overall. Japan was described as having high-quality
researchers, strong funding, and good infrastructure. In addition, our respondents credited
Japan’s high-quality graduate programs and saw increased international exchanges for Japanese
students and scientists as contributing factors to Japan’s success. China, too, was observed as
improving the quality of its research in this field as a result of heavy Chinese research investment
and overseas education and experience for Chinese scientists. (See Appendix B, summaries
16, 17, and 18.)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">Environmental Science</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Feedback from our 11 respondents points to a shared view that Japan’s achievements in these
fields stem from strong funding and good facilities and equipment available to Japanese
researchers, as well as the diligence of Japanese researchers. While Japan ranked high overall,
there was a view shared by our respondents that Japan’s performance should be stronger given
the resources available. Among the top institutions named were the Earthquake Research

Institute, the National Institute of Polar Research, Kyoto University, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology, and the University of Tokyo.<br><br>
Environment/Ecology. Japan overall was rated as doing well but not a world leader in the
subfields addressed by our respondents. In earth-science research, Japan was regarded as competitive.
In geochemicals, Japan was said to produce good technical work. In biodiversity, bioecology,
biodiversity restoration, zoological ecology, evolutionary ecology, and entomology,
Japan was rated as doing well or fairly well. Respondents all took the view that Japan should be
performing better than it is considering the resources, infrastructure, and human talent available.
(See Appendix B, summaries 19C24.)<br><br>
Energy Engineering. Our two respondents ranked Japan as a very advanced or leading
country in this field. They attributed a major part of Japan’s success to strong funding and
high-quality facilities. One respondent observed that top-flight industry research laboratories
(e.g., Toshiba) produce higher-quality work than universities in Japan. He was optimistic that
new ties between academia and industry in Japan could bring more research money to and
improve the quality of research at university laboratories. (See Appendix B, summaries 25 and
26.)<br><br>
Geoscience. Our three respondents rated Japan as belonging to the middle tier, alongside
China, in global rankings for geoscience. Again, Japan was viewed as doing better in
research that requires expensive equipment for data collection or measurement than in theoretical
research. For example, one respondent rated Japan as doing respectable to very good work
in ocean drilling where technology development is concerned but noted that Japan would not
be a world leader in this area because it biases against theoretical research. In this regard, our
respondents expected China and India, which were seen to give more emphasis to theoretical
research, to continue their rise and perhaps surpass Japan one day. (See Appendix B, summaries
27, 28, and 29.)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">Information and Communication Technology</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Overall, our 10 respondents rated Japan as producing good to top-quality work, but not cuttingedge
research. Japanese excellence was seen largely in its technical work, rather than in fundamental
research. In their view, the United States is by far the world’s leader. The top institutions
named included the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), Keio
University, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial
Science and Technology (AIST), the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), Sony, the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and the University
of Tokyo.<br><br>
Computer Science, Applied. Within this field, four respondents rated Japan as doing
high-quality work that is technically strong and fundamentally innovative. However, Japanese
research was not seen as on par with research in leading countries, such as Britain and
Germany. Our respondents cited current research on next-generation Internet as a particularly
noteworthy undertaking. The Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International
(ATR) was commended for its efforts to expand international research collaborations. (See
Appendix B, summaries 30C33.)<br><br>
Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Our two respondents’ ratings of Japanese research
in this field were largely positive. Japan was seen as a leader behind the United States and EU,
which were described as producing superior research results and technologies. Japan’s work on
carbon nanotubes was especially noted. (See Appendix B, summaries 34 and 35.)<br><br>


Mechanical Engineering. One respondent provided input for this field. Although he could
not name them individually, he commented that Japan has some good research institutes and
some of the world’s leading experts in this field. (See Appendix B, summary 36.)<br><br>
Mathematics. For the field as a whole, our three respondents took the view that Japan
produces good but not cutting-edge research. In the subfield of computational logic, Japan was
described as producing high-quality research and active in international collaborations. The
country was ranked third after the United States and Germany, with the University of Tokyo
and Kyoto University named as the top institutions in Japan. In bioinformatics, Japan was
rated highly for its technical work but was said to be less proficient in mathematical development.
(See Appendix B, summaries 37, 38, and 39.)<br><br>

Our 16 respondents had varying opinions on Japan’s performance in the fields and subfields in
this category. Their assessments of Japanese research ranged from “respectable” to “top quality”
to being on par with the world’s best. Although Japan’s competitiveness was seen primarily
to be on the technical side, Japan was also praised for producing important original and
innovative ideas. Having a high level of research funding and good infrastructure are essential,
according to our respondents. They also credit Japan’s active participation in large international
research programs and increased openness (e.g., international exchanges and publication
in international journals) for helping to improve Japan’s overall performance in the fields
and subfields in this category. The top institutions named were AIST, Kyoto University, Meijo
University, NIMS, Osaka University, RIKEN, the University of Tsukuba, the Toyota Technological
Institute, and the University of Tokyo.<br><br>
Chemical, Basic. For this field, overall, Japan was commended for having made significant
improvements in the past two decades, including increased publication in the top journals.
Japan’s efforts to send more students and researchers abroad and expansion in collaborative
research with Europe and the United States were also cited as important to this outcome.
Rankings for Japan ranged from being in the middle range among the world’s top ten to being
second after the United States and ahead of Germany. (See Appendix B, summaries 40 and
41.)<br><br>
Chemical, Applied. Two respondents provided feedback to us; each commented on different
subfields. In the areas of photovoltaics and microelectronics, Japan was ranked a world
leader. In organic chemistry, by contrast, our respondent did not think that Japan was a leader.
In his opinion, Ireland, Finland, and Denmark are producing more high-quality work and
catching up with the United States, Britain, Germany, and France, which, he remarked, are
the leaders in this area. (See Appendix B, summaries 42 and 43.)<br><br>
Materials Science, Metals. Overall, our three respondents rated Japanese research in
this field as competitive, high-quality, and groundbreaking in some instances (e.g., battery
research, building the Earth Simulators). The best Japanese researchers were reported to be
internationally renowned. They also observed that Japan’s hosting of international conferences
has improved exposure of Japanese researchers to the latest research. (See Appendix B, summaries
44C46.)<br><br>
Materials Science, Polymers. One respondent from this field provided input and rated
Japanese research as “absolutely competitive.” Japan was commended, in particular, for producing
detailed and difficult work when the highest technical capability is required. (See
Appendix B, summary 47.)<br><br>

<a href= "pic50.html">日本的真心话和大冒险</a><br><br>
Materials Science, Semiconductors. Our two respondents from this field rated Japan as
a world leader and expect it to stay a world leader well into the future. They highlighted, in
particular, Japan’s contributions to photovoltaic research on lithium-ion batteries and the use
of titanium-dioxide as a photo catalyst. Japan’s research on amorphous crystalline silicon cells
and injection cells were also described as innovative. Finally, they praised Japan’s ability to turn
ideas into commercial products. (See Appendix B, summaries 48 and 49.)<br><br>
Physics, Basic. Three respondents provided input on Japanese research in this field. In the
area of theoretical physics, one respondent said that Japan is very strong and has demonstrated
visible improvements in recent years. Further, Japan was rated as on par with other leading
nations and expected to remain a leader in the coming years. In the areas of astrophysics and
gravitational wave physics, a rapid growth in Japanese research capacity was also observed by
our respondents. For the latter, Japan was reported to have moved from a position of “significant
weakness” to being at the forefront of research. By comparison, in high-energy physics,
Japan was not expected to do better because of the absence of critical research infrastructure.
(See Appendix B, summaries 50C52.)<br><br>
Physics, Applied. Our three respondents in general concurred that Japan’s strength in this
field is primarily in doing technical work (e.g., computer programming) rather than in producing
theoretical, groundbreaking research. Thus, while they considered Japan to be doing well,
they did not see Japan rivaling the United States or Germany, which they regard as the leaders
in this field. (See Appendix B, summaries 53C55.)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">Quality of Human Capital and Training, Research Organization and Management, Infrastructure, and National Policy</a> </b><br>

Our interviews with the 55 leading scientists asked them to comment on the quality of training
(from high school through Ph.D. level in science), human capital (primarily scientists),
infrastructure (facilities, equipment), organization and research management, and national
policy (including funding and other policies to promote S&T capacity). Respondents could
address conditions within their own field or subfields (most did) and for Japan as a whole.<br><br>
If they did not have any knowledge about conditions in Japan, they were asked to comment
on what qualities in all these areas would be required for a country to establish excellence.<br><br>
Responses for the latter are incorporated into the section of this report that presents recommendations
from the respondents. Observations offered by our respondents are consistent with
those we received from experts interviewed for our 2004 study. The perception that Japan has
potentially good talent but that independent and creative thinking is constrained by social and
institutional forces continues to be a major theme in their comments.<br><br>

	Respondents in most cases reported that there are good researchers in Japan in their field, some
even outstanding or world-class. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 1 and 43.) A few
respondents, however, considered Japanese researchers or postdoctoral fellows they know to be
low in quality, at least relative to those from countries regarded as leaders in their fields. (See,
for example, Appendix B, summaries 14 and 35.) The majority of the respondents professed
inadequate in-depth knowledge about the Japanese education system at the undergraduate
and graduate levels to comment on how well they educate scientists. On the whole, there was

a view that the Japanese education system does adequately well, but it was not perceived to do
a good job in teaching students how to think independently. (See, for example, Appendix B,
summaries 4, 29, and 42.) Further, more than half of our respondents highlighted their perception
that individuals would not be inclined to challenge conventional thinking or authority
within the rigid social hierarchical structure in Japan. More than half of our respondents
commented that hierarchical structures permeate Japanese society, including its research community.<br><br>
Such hierarchical structures, in their view, are not conducive to enabling independent
thinking, creative research, or innovative ideas. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 6,
15, 27, and 44.)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">Organization and Research Management</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The single most common point of criticism voiced by our respondents is the lack of openness
in the Japanese system to foreign persons and ideas. A few respondents said that Japan is
becoming more open (e.g., the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JSPS] and RIKEN
provide more opportunities for non-Japanese researchers to work with them). (See Appendix
B, summaries 24, 35, and 43.) However, the vast majority of our respondents perceived the
Japanese system as closed to non-Japanese (e.g., that it is rare for non-Japanese researchers to
obtain permanent positions in Japan). (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 19, 29, 36,
45, and 48.)<br><br>
In terms of research management, criticism again focused on respondents’ perceptions of
a rigid hierarchical structure in Japan. Top researchers or laboratory leaders were seen to have
dominant control over the resources for a research group or even a field in Japan. This control
would allow them to decide the research topics and how to approach them, to the point of stifling
creativity and productivity. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 7, 15, 44, and 48).<br><br>
In their view, having the freedom to explore ideas―backed with resources to do it―is what
engenders creative and high-quality work. Further, independent research suffers, especially for
young scientists who are not in a position to negotiate with their supervisors. Respondents also
noted how such hierarchies dissuade non-Japanese scientists and Japanese scientists overseas
from choosing to work in Japan. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 7, 8, 13, 48, and
52.)<br><br>
There is broad concurrence among our respondents that this strict hierarchical structure
in research management is deleterious to Japanese research. At the same time, our respondents
recognize that culture and mindsets are difficult to change, especially when this strict hierarchy
in the Japanese scientific community is a reflection of Japanese society itself. (See, for
example, Appendix B, summaries 7, 9, 12C15, 18, 21, 27, 29, 30, 35C37, 44, 52, and 53.)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Research Infrastructure</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
	Overall, Japan’s research infrastructure was viewed by our respondents as good to world-class
and even the best in the world. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 5, 10, 15, 35, 38,
40, and 54.) A respondent in the electrical and electronics engineering field described Japan
as having more-sophisticated infrastructure than any other country; another―in the polymers
field―also described Japan’s infrastructure as “top end.” Several respondents reported
improvement in Japan’s research infrastructure (e.g., in applied computing and mechanical
engineering). (See Appendix B, summaries 32 and 36.) Indeed, only in a few instances was
Japanese research infrastructure described as lagging compared with the leading countries (in
environment/ecology) or missing (in basic physics). (See Appendix B, summaries 21 and 51.)<br><br>

Having good research infrastructure―though necessary―is not sufficient to excellence
in research. Several respondents noted the issue of access to research facilities. (See Appendix
B, summaries 6, 9, and 18.) At issue is whether individual researchers, especially younger
ones, could access facilities and equipment to conduct their research when a senior laboratory
leader may not allow it. Respondents also raised this in terms of access by research groups
outside of one’s own team or institution (e.g., industry research using facilities and equipment
managed by universities). Several respondents raised this issue in light of their understanding
about how research is organized and managed in Japan. Without access to facilities and equipment,
they explained, individual researchers would not be able to conduct experiments to test
their ideas and advance their own independent research agendas. If access problems exist, it
would be all the more burdensome for young scientists who are working to launch their careers
and establish their credentials. One respondent added that difficulties in access could also stifle
enthusiasm in scientific research―something that is critical to producing innovative research.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
Most respondents did not consider themselves sufficiently informed about this topic to comment
on it. Some respondents said that they were glad to see the Japanese government funding
more international activities (e.g., fellowships, exchanges, and conferences). Others cautioned
against excessive government control of the national research agenda―stifling bottom-up initiation
of research ideas and the possibility of “betting on the wrong horse.” (See, for example,
Appendix B, summaries 29, 30, and 55.) In general, respondents complimented Japan for providing
a good level of financial support of research and purchase of equipment. They faulted
the Japanese government instead on the concentration of resources among a small number of
top scientists and institutions.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Major Strengths in Japanese Research</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
There was fairly broad consensus among the respondents that there are clear strengths in the
Japanese research. Among the most frequently mentioned were strong funding, good research
infrastructure, hardworking and meticulous researchers, and proficiency in technical work.<br><br>
These observations, too, are consistent with responses received from experts for our 2004 study.<br><br>
Top Scientists Are Well Funded
With rare exceptions, Japanese researchers and their research programs were seen by our respondents
as well funded. There is a strong perception among our respondents that the Japanese
government provides good research support to the scientific community in general and its top
scientists and research institutions in particular. Also, there is a broadly shared view among our
respondents that research support in Japan is more stable because of clear government-driven
research priorities and the centralized allocation of public research funds. This allows research
groups in Japan to work without worrying too much about losing support in subsequent funding
cycles. Instead of expending endless hours writing grant proposals, Japanese researchers
can actually focus on their research. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 1, 6, 14, 21,
35, 37, and 38.)<br><br>


Japan Has Good Research Infrastructure<br><br>
As described in the previous section, most respondents reported experiencing or having the
impression that Japan has good research infrastructure. In their view, this allows universities
and other public research institutions in Japan to invest in state-of-the-art research facilities
and equipment. A few of our respondents commented that having sophisticated equipment
can give a research team the competitive advantage (e.g., in geoscience and energy engineering
research). (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 9, 20, 25, 28, and 55.)<br><br>
Japanese Researchers Are Hardworking and Meticulous<br><br>
Although it was a point that was more often implied than explicitly stated, our respondents
shared the view that Japanese researchers (including graduate students) are hardworking and
meticulous. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 8, 21, 31, 42, and 54.) A few respondents,
in particular, highlighted the willingness of Japanese researchers to put in long hours to
conduct and repeat experiments to obtain clear results, and the care they take to review data
earned compliments. Further, a few respondents also praised the strong sense of team spirit and
individual commitment that they observed among scientists in Japan.<br><br>
Japan Excels in Developing Technologies and Equipment-Driven Research<br><br>
Japan’s prowess in developing technologies and putting ideas into products was widely shared
by our respondents. In microscopy technology, for example, Japan was credited with having
made critical contributions to its development. Another respondent who is a leading scientist in
polymer research said that Japan is especially good at doing work that requires high technical
capability. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 6, 31, 47, and 53.) Overall, our respondents
perceived an emphasis on technology development over fundamental research in Japan.<br><br>
(See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 29, 31, 35, and 47.)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">Major Hindrances to Greater Excellence</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Given Japan’s strengths described in the previous section, many respondents said that they
would have expected Japan to produce higher-quality and more-creative research. (See, for
example Appendix B, summaries 34, 39, 43, and 47.) We asked our respondents to offer their
thoughts on what might be holding them back. Their responses largely converged on the points
presented in this section, according to how frequently they were cited by our respondents, and
they, too, are consistent with expert responses in our 2004 study.<br><br>
英语不好！<br><br>
Low Proficiency in English<br><br>
Feedback from our respondents showed clear consensus on one point: Low proficiency in English
among Japanese researchers and students hinders communication with the international
scientific community. English, in our respondents’ view, is the de facto lingua franca of the
international scientific community, so that limited proficiency in English becomes a handicap.<br><br>
Several respondents attributed low proficiency in English as a hindrance to the publication of
Japanese research in international scientific journals. In their view, when Japanese research is
not visible to the international scientific community, researchers outside Japan have limited
awareness of what is being done in Japan and the quality of that work, and therefore are less
motivated to seek collaboration with Japanese researchers. For example, one European-based respondent cited the language barrier as one reason for choosing the United States over Japan
for an overseas research experience. Several respondents also thought that low proficiency in
English was a barrier to more-effective interaction between Japanese researchers and their
international peers at conferences, on the Internet, and in formal and informal discussions.
(See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 2, 6, 13, 14, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 39, 31, 33, 34, 36,
42, 46, and 48.) <br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T15">Cultural Barriers and Rigid Hierarchical Structure</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	Respondents also expressed concern about the ability or willingness of Japanese researchers to
communicate. Low proficiency in English could hinder Japanese researchers from effectively
communicating their work in print and in oral communication. However, proficiency in English
does not guarantee effective communication. Cultural norms reinforced by the strict hierarchical
structure in Japanese society were expressed explicitly by more than one-fifth of our
respondents as hindering Japanese researchers from freely expressing themselves or questioning
authority. Such inhibitions, in the view of our respondents, hinder Japanese researchers from
exploring the big questions in scientific research. They added that a self-restraining mentality
and a constrictive cultural environment could be especially harmful to young researchers who
should be seeking and testing new ideas. Our respondents underscored that such an environment
would make Japan unattractive to both talented and ambitious Japanese and non-Japanese
researchers alike. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 6, 7, 9, and 29.)<br><br>
Also, a system that is ruled by hierarchy rather than merit would not allow young scientists
or brilliant researchers to rise or to freely pursue their research. When the leader of a laboratory
is the only one permitted to make creative decisions, intellectual freedom and creativity
are stifled and ambitious young scientists may become apathetic. Enthusiasm, our respondents
underscored, is critical to excellence in research. Also, some of our respondents opined that
Japanese culture discourages risk-taking and acceptance of failure, both of which are essential
for creative ideas to emerge and be tested. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 3 and 11.)
A strict hierarchical structure could also make it much more time-consuming to get
things done (e.g., going through each layer to obtain a decision from the top leader). For non-
Japanese scientists, especially from North America (and, increasingly, Europe, where hierarchies
are being dismantled), our respondents stressed that such a rigid hierarchical environment
would make Japan an unattractive place to work for any talented researcher. (See, for
example, Appendix B, summaries 4, 6, 8, 12, 27, 35C37, 44, 48, 49, and 52.)<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T16">Low Value Given to Fundamental Research</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Feedback from our respondents indicates that excellence in technology development is not a
solid foundation for innovative or groundbreaking research. Consequently, few of our respondents
rated Japan as a leader in their field or subfield when they observed that strength in
Japanese research lies primarily in technology development rather than fundamental research.
Their comments indicate their perception that research funding in Japan is strongly biased
against fundamental research because policymakers favor technology development for its visibility
and commercial profit potential. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 21, 23, 29,
31, 39, 53, and 55.)<br><br>

Absence of Women in Research<br><br>
The virtual absence of female researchers in Japan was raised broadly by our respondents
regardless of their career status, gender, location, or field. In their view, not opening research
careers to women diminished Japan’s labor pool by half. This was all the more problematic considering
that Japanese society is rapidly aging. Respondents reported that Japanese women in
science rarely assume leadership positions and are forced to leave their positions if they marry
or have children. Even those who choose to pursue careers in science are more likely employed
as laboratory technicians than as researchers. Female workers in Japan were also seen as victims
of male discrimination, with behaviors that one respondent said would be considered sexual
harassment in the United States. Both male and female respondents who commented on this
point said that discrimination against women makes Japan a less attractive place for foreign
students and researchers―male and female alike―as well as Japanese women who want to
pursue scientific careers. A few respondents remarked that Japanese women may be better off
pursuing their scientific careers outside Japan than within it. (See Appendix B, summaries 4,
6, 8, 9, 11, 21, 22, 32, 41, and 46.)<br><br>
Japan Is Invisible and Insular<br><br>
Nearly one-fifth of our respondents expressed the view that Japanese research lacks visibility
internationally. For example, they commented that Japanese research is not prominent in the
major scientific journals in their fields and that Japanese researchers are not actively engaged
in Internet blogs for scientific discussions. In their view, research not seen is not known, and
this limits opportunities for exchanges and collaborations. The situation was reported to be
improving at some institutions (e.g., scientists were required to publish their research in English),
and strong Japanese government support to organize and host major conferences and
seminars in Japan also helps to expose Japanese institutions and researchers international audiences.
(See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 2, 20C22, 24, 30, 31, and 34.)<br><br>
In this connection, nearly one-fifth of our respondents also criticized Japan for being
too insular. There were observations that Japanese research published in Japanese-language
journals limits access to Japanese researchers. A few respondents reported seeing changes at
RIKEN and via JSPS scholarships to bring more foreign scientific talent into Japan for shortterm
exchanges. Our respondents said that these actions are good starts but counseled that
much more needs to be done. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 16, 24, 25, and 48.)
Another dimension of insularity pertains to our respondents’ perception that too few
Japanese students are studying overseas and too few young Japanese scientists are experiencing
research overseas. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 22, 48, and 54.) The Chinese
experience was cited by more than one-fifth of our respondents to demonstrate the positive
impact that international education and research experience can have on improving national
S&T capacity. Several respondents explicitly compared their Chinese and Japanese experiences.<br><br>
For example, Chinese researchers and students were characterized as more open to
learning new ideas, trying them out, and considering alternative viewpoints, as well as more
active in publishing in leading international journals than their Japanese peers. Such attitudes,
combined with significant Chinese investment in S&T, were noted by our respondents as
the basis for their optimism about China’s future in their scientific fields. (See, for example,
Appendix B, summaries 6, 7, 11, 17, 18, 27, 31, 47, 48, and 53.)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T17">Recommendations from the Experts</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
We asked respondents to recommend ways to mitigate weaknesses they observed and to increase
excellence in Japanese S&T. As described earlier, if a respondent had little or no familiarity
with Japan, he or she was requested to share with us what they thought were factors essential
to excellence in S&T and to name models, experiences, or institutions that they considered to
be exemplary. Thus, this section is a summary of recommendations from our respondents per
agreement with our research sponsor. It is not within the scope of this research to assess the
validity of the viewpoints expressed by our respondents or the appropriateness of recommendations
they provide. These recommendations are presented in order of the frequency for which
they were mentioned and not in order of sequence or hierarchy.<br><br>
Increase Proficiency in English<br><br>
Improving proficiency in both oral and written English was underscored as a fundamental
requirement. Our respondents said that, without a high level of English language capacity,
Japanese scientists cannot be effective participants in science at a global scale, since they cannot
engage in exchanges with their peers worldwide via publications or the Internet or in person
in formal or informal forums. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 19, 21,
30, 33, 42, and 48.)<br><br>
Many other respondents also recommended this implicitly in their recommendations that
more Japanese students should go overseas for education and more Japanese scientists and faculty
should gain research and teaching experience outside Japan. There was also a suggestion
to require Japanese researchers to write proposals in English as a way to improve their English
capacity. One respondent in Germany underscored the importance of English by informing us
that he requires his research team members to work only in English as a way to increase their
capacity to engage with the global science community, and he reported that this has helped his
students to more effectively participate in international research activities. (See Appendix B,
summaries 33 and 42.)<br><br>
Recruiting more international students and faculty and increasing international R&D
collaborations were also suggested as ways to improve English capacity for Japanese students
and researchers. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 1, 3, 19C21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30,
33C35, 37, 43C45, 47, 48, 51, 54, and 55.)<br><br>
Since increasing English language capacity among Japanese students and researchers can
take time, there was a suggestion to provide “special funds for professional translation” to help
Japanese students and researchers to prepare grant proposals and papers for submission to
international journals and conferences. In this respondent’s view, even Japanese students and
researchers with a high level of proficiency in English could benefit from such professional
assistance and improve their visibility and engagement with the global scientific community.
He reported that he has seen this approach work well in China, helping to raise the international
profile of Chinese research. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 2, 6, 13, 14, 18,
21, 22, 24, 25, 31, 33, 34, 36, 42, 46, and 48.)<br><br>
Emphasize Merit Above All Else<br><br>
A number of recommendations were tied to cultural barriers in Japan. Our respondents stressed
that the rigid hierarchical structure and deference to seniority and authority (the two go hand

in hand) must be dismantled and replaced by a merit-based system to allow talent to rise, whatever
the age, race, or gender of the researcher might be.<br><br>
Merit, in the view of our respondents, should be the central criterion for research grants,
hiring, promotion, and all else. In particular, to break the restrictive hierarchy and mindset,
research grants should emphasize bottom-up research proposals and support high-risk
research. Also, considering the weak position that women and junior researchers occupy in
Japan, special grant programs that target them could give them a much-needed boost.
Our respondents stressed that, until Japanese students and researchers can think freely
and until their creativity is valued, Japan will continue to do good work, but it will not be
doing cutting-edge research and be a global leader in science. One senior researcher with a
high level of knowledge about Japanese S&T remarked that, when original work is produced
in Japan, it is the result of persistence by creative scientists rather than generous funding or
equipment. This is not to dismiss that funding and equipment are important, but these inputs
alone do not produce creative research. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 4, 7, 18, 27,
37, 44, and 46.)<br><br>
Further Open Japan to the International Scientific Community<br><br>
There was broad consensus among our respondents that Japan should further open itself to
the entry of foreign students, faculty, and researchers into the Japanese education and research
systems for short-term stays and long-term appointments. One proposal is that adding scholarships
and fellowships that target high-caliber international students and researchers would be
helpful.<br><br>
Our respondents commented that having more foreign students, faculty, and researchers
present in the Japanese education and research systems might help to improve English
language proficiency among their Japanese peers, expose them to different ideas and ways of
thinking, and foster a culture that values creativity and rewards risk-taking and excellence
rather than rank and seniority. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 3, 9, and 13C15.)<br><br>
Increase Outflow of Japanese Students and Researchers<br><br>
Japan should send more students and researchers overseas for education, exposure, and experience.
Respondents said that the case for doing so might not be clear cut, because good graduate
programs are available in Japan. However, they underscored that overseas experience could
not only increase knowledge or skills in scientific research, but also help to improve intercultural
communication skills and expand professional networks―both of which are essential
to improve excellence in S&T. In their estimation, it may take some time―perhaps five, ten,
or more years―to produce a significant impact, but such efforts are much needed and should
begin immediately. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 1, 4, and 8.)<br><br>
Emphasize Critical and Independent Thinking in Japan’s Secondary and Tertiary Education
Systems<br><br>
Respondents spoke of a need for Japan’s education system to change. Respondents widely
shared the view that the current system in Japan―at all levels―does not teach students to
think critically. In their view, the emphasis on learning “what” over questioning “why” is counter
to the culture of science. Further, while Japan may do well in international rankings of science
and math test scores, the current system produces good researchers but not outstanding
ones because they are unable to challenge the state of the art to forge new ground.<br><br>

Respondents’ recommendations ranged from changes beginning at the kindergarten level
to making the undergraduate and graduate programs more open and rigorous. Nevertheless,
most agreed that changes at the secondary level are important to prepare young people to
become more independent and creative thinkers at the college level and in their professional
careers.<br><br>
Our respondents broadly saw the university system in the United States as the best in the
world. They praised its openness to all ideas and people from around the world, as well as its
ability to prepare students to become good teachers and researchers. Ireland, Portugal, Germany,
Britain, and several other countries were named for successful reforms to make their
university more competitive in the global market for talented students and researchers. In
many cases, our respondents said they borrowed elements from the U.S. system in their own
work and institutions.<br><br>
Finally, according to our respondents, students beginning at the undergraduate level
should learn how to read research papers and write grant proposals and research papers in
English and be involved in hands-on research activities, including international collaborations.
(See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 3, 15, 20, and 53.)<br><br>
Continue to Fund Research, Including More Support for International R&D, and to Improve<br><br>
Research Facilities and Workplace Quality<br><br>
Overall, respondents emphasized that money should be allocated on the basis of merit, whether
it is for research or facilities. Where research funding is concerned, they counseled a careful
balance between applied and fundamental research.<br><br>
They also recommended targeted funding to incentivize and support more Japanese and
non-Japanese researchers to work together. One option might be special funds to pay for travel
associated with international exchanges or, as described earlier, for professional services to assist
Japanese researchers in preparing articles for international publication.<br><br>
International collaboration might also be made a requirement for research grants for
students and young researchers. Our respondents repeatedly pointed to the EU experience
(the Erasmus and Marie Curie programs, in particular) as very effective in fostering research
cooperation and graduate-student mobility across EU member countries. In addition, our
respondents suggested that grants could be used to encourage innovative, higher-risk research
to motivate researchers to think creatively or as seed money to help young researchers to set
up their own research laboratories (as is done in the United States and increasingly in other
places). Funds might also be used to leverage industry investment in the national research
enterprise and promote university-industry research linkages. (See, for example, Appendix B,
summaries 10, 11, 16, 20, 35, 48, and 53.)<br><br>
Aside from funding research, respondents familiar with institutions in Japan also recommended
funding to improve facilities and the workplace environment. While our respondents
remarked that Japanese laboratories are generally well equipped and frequently have worldclass
equipment, the buildings that host the equipment and provide work and social space are
not always world-class. A quality workplace, in the view of our respondents, can make Japan
more attractive to international students and researchers and provide settings that can better
stimulate social and professional interaction. (See, for example, Appendix B, summaries 8, 17,
20, 24, 27, 29, 30, 33, 36, 37, 43, and 45.)<br><br>
